<h1>The Tech Industry and a Tidal Wave of Unemployment </h1>

<img src="/imgs/seri_help.jpg" alt="seri asking for help">

<h2>As technology advances jobs sectors are going to be destroyed at a rate so quick that it has no historical precedent. History has shown us though that when unemployment rates become too high the social and political consequences are real: ranging from protests to riots, and even full blown revolutions. In this post I will discuss advancements in the tech industry and the tsunami of unemployment coming in the direction of industrial societies </h2>

<h4>21/06/2015</h4>

<p>
When I was an undergraduate in my final year at Trinity College Dublin, I couldn't help but notice that the university had installed a "Fast Lane Self-Service System" in the library. It was a system where students can loan out college books in an entirely automated process which besides from direct input from the user, the system does not require human input to run. Four years prior to this, the Darien public library in Connecticut bought self-service check-out machines. Now, with customers scanning books themselves, the library is processing more books than ever while shaving 15 percent from staff hours by using fewer part-time workers. An ominous sign of what is to come in labor markets around the world.
</p>

<p>
Before the arrival of this machine what did we do? We dealt with a librarian when taking out books.

<p>
Before I continue let me offer 2 quick disclaimers about what this post is not about. This blog is not a Luddite's attack against advancements in technology as there are many benefits which come with technological advancements, I'm just highlighting one potential problem coming out of advancements from the tech industry: high levels of unemployment as labor markets are displaced. The second disclaimer is that this post does not aim to create a new paradigm for societies to function in a sustainable way with automated machines, however I will briefly offer some possible responses to the problem in the conclusion. Rather again I will attempt to extrapolate on the potential unemployment problem that might arise with advancements in technology.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to take the example of Google's <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_google_s_driverless_car?language=en"> driverless cars </a> as a microcosm for what is happening across numerous other employment sectors. (Ironically as I write this my text editor underlines the word "driverless" in red, thinking the word is a spelling error. This technology which will soon be so disruptive, is about to become known very soon).

<p>
For the uninitiated driverless cars are incredible. They are autonomous vehicles which are capable of sensing its environment through GPS, highly powerful motion sensors, radar and computer vision which allows the cars to navigate without any human input at all. Almost all major car manufactures (BMW, Ford, GM, Toyota, Nissan, Volvo and Audi and even Telsa) aim to release a commercial version by 2020 latest with some companies such as Telsa claiming to be on course for releasing a commercial version even earlier. Nevada was the first state in early 2012 to ratify its laws allowing for the driverless vehicle, the cars can be seen driving up and down highways in Nevada and in between San Fransisco, LA and Silicon Valley. The cars can change lanes, stop for pedestrians and park all without any human input at all.

<p>
The transition towards societies with driverless cars are inevitable, they are safer, more fuel efficient, better for the economy and require no human input for the users commute.
But how will this advanced technology that requires no input from humans destroy more jobs in the future then it creates?
Well let’s consider those employed in the automobile industry in America all of whom will come under threat by the driverless cars. Adding bus drivers, taxi men and truckers there are a little over 4 million people employed in this industry.
</p>

<p>
Why does the current situation merit close attention from politicians and policy makers relative to past trends? In the past when a new technology replaces an old technology new jobs are created and after a period of readjustment employment rates remain stable. However the difference between past trends and now is that because technology has become so advanced and autonomous, the need for human input for machines to function is becoming greatly reduced and in some cases not needed at all for machines to function. With less demand for human input we could see a large unemployment problem in the future. The driverless car will soon become the first of many hugely disruptive <b> autonomous machines. </b>
</p>

<p>
Reflecting the significance of the transition taking place the noble laureate economist Wassily Leontief said “the role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then eliminated by the introduction of tractors.”
</p>

<p>
Political stability and the survival of our economies and societies in general depends largely on employment levels being kept relatively high. When machines become a more and more dominant factor of production political systems and economies which operate on the current paradigm of people being the main factor or production will be put under massive strain. Thus we can see the importance of how advances in technologies which require less human input and cause unemployment levels to rise massively is an important issue in contemporary politics.
</p>

<p>
Before jumping into the data and academic research to defend my argument that advanced machines will create an unemployment problem in the future I’d like to briefly explain three big factors that give machines the advantage over humans as being the main factor of production in economies of the future:</p>


<h2>Smarter Machines</h2>
<p> Software is becoming more and more competent and at a faster and faster rate too which results in intelligent machines encroaching more and more in the field of humans. Though many machines are still working out the kinks, software is making machines and devices smarter and more competent at performing the jobs traditionally done by humans every year.</p>

<h2>BIG DATA</h2>
<p> Machines are better at analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data then humans and right now more information passes through the internet in a second then the entire internet put together just 20 years ago. Computers can offer valuable insights into decision makers in business and government agencies from huge amounts of data that humans can’t. For example Walmarts computer program analyzed twitter traffic and helped convince the chain to increase its amount of “Avengers” merchandise, Google's driverless cars also operate on large amounts of data feed to it by high powered sensory equipment. The availability of big data in our societies and the ability of machines to interpret and analyze large data sets effectively gives the advantage to machines in employment sectors.</p>

<h2>The Cloud</h2>
<p> Cloud computing is a catch-all term for the ability to rent as much computer power as you need without having to buy it. Cloud computing reduces the opportunity cost for businesses of investing in technology over human labour. Even small businesses which have no budget for a big technology department can take advantage of the cheap computer power offered by the cloud.</p>


<h1> Academic Support </h2>

<h2>Oxford Academics' Opinion on Tech-Unemployment Problem </h2>
The University of Oxford’s programme on the Impacts of Future Technology attempted to quantify the extent of the threat that rapid advances in technology posed on employment levels. 700 jobs were considered in the study and each job was assigned different weights depending on the education required for the job, the skills required, how automatable the jobs was, and what were the current technological obstacles in the way that prevented computerization. The Oxford researchers say that 45% of America’s occupations will be automated within the next 20 years.
</p>

<h2> MIT Academics' Opinion on the Tech-Unemployment Problem </h2>
<p>
Increases in technology tend to hollow out middle class jobs and polarize the workforce according to David Autor an economist in MIT. Computers have increasingly taken over such tasks as bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production jobs in manufacturing — all of which typically provided middle-class pay. At the same time, higher-paying jobs and jobs in the arts and sciences requiring creativity and problem-solving skills, often aided by computers, have proliferated. So have low-skill jobs: demand has increased for restaurant workers, janitors, home health aides, and others doing service work that is nearly impossible to automate. The polarization of the workforce problem will not only create unemployment issues but also exacerbate any income inequality issues present in developed Western countries.
</p>

<p>
The MIT professor in the Sloan School of Management Erik Brynjolfsson and his collaborator and co-author Andrew McAfee believe that rapid technological change has been destroying jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the stagnation of median income and the growth of inequality in the United States. They also suspect, something similar is happening in other technologically advanced countries. The two MIT academics produce evidence to support this claim which they call the great decoupling.
</p>

<<img src="/imgs/tech_driven_unemployment_us.jpg" alt="productivity vs unemployment">

<p>
Brynjolfsson and McAfee believe advances in technology is the reason why we have seen a dichotomy from the year 2000 onwards where productivity has actually risen but at the same time employment levels have gone down. The MIT professors call this the great decoupling. Historically these lines have always followed each other but Brynjolfsson and McAfee both believe that because technology have become so advanced productivity has continued to go up, but the technology that is driving this increase in productivity is now capable of functioning with <b> less and less human input </b> which means that employment levels are going down. This is strong evidence which points towards a technology unemployment problem.
</p>

<p>
I personally believe that we should pay even closer attention to the issue of technology causing an unemployment problem in the future because it’s pernicious effects can be masked by other macroeconomic variables which also create unemployment. For example events related to global trade and the financial crisis of the early and late 2000s were also responsible for unemployment rates to rise. Although some economists such as Maarten Goos at Belgium’s University of Leuven claim that 2/3 of the 7.6 million middle class jobs that vanished in Europe were the victims of technology other academics are more conservative with their estimates. Labour economist Richard Freeman of Harvard University says it’s very hard to extricate the effects of technology from other macroeconomic effects. However I believe that we should not take comfort in this fact. Since it is difficult to analyze the effects of technological advancement in job destruction and furthermore since there has never been a historical precedent for us to use as a guide then maybe we are in danger of under appreciating the issue until the unemployment problem can no longer be ignored, much like a cancer left untreated will become malignant if not addressed.
</p>

<h2> The Speed at Which Technology Advances </h2>

<p>
Now I’d like to discuss the speed at which technology advances and how this is a huge reason why we should pay close attention to how it effects employment levels. Technology advances at an exponential rate meaning that it doubles from one period to the next as opposed to increasing in fixed intervals. This can best be reflected by Moore’s law which states that computer processing speed doubles every 18 months. Moore’s law has held remarkably accurate since he created it in 1965.We are at a risk of under appreciating how fast technology advances and therefore we are at risk of being very vulnerable to the potentially large and sudden unemployment problem that might face future societies. (To reiterate my text editor still thought the word "driverless" was a typo) </p>

<img src="/imgs/moores_law.jpg" alt="Moores Law">


<p>
If you find it difficult to comprehend the rate at which technology evolves think of the impact that technology has had on computers “In 1970 undergraduates in MIT would share a computer that would take up half of the building, the computer in your smartphones today is a million times cheaper and a thousand times more powerful. That’s a billion fold increase in price performance of computing since 1970.
</p>


<p>
A key assumption which this argument rests upon is that in the future sufficient levels of new jobs will not arise when the old jobs previously performed by human input are performed by machines. Therefore it is worth investigating this assumption further. The Harvard professor of economics Lawrence Katz has done extensive research on how technological advances have affected jobs over the last few centuries. Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is something different about today’s digital technology. On the assumption that technology today will create an unemployment problem in the future Katz says that this is a serious issue worth considering. The Harvard economist says “if technology disrupts enough, who knows what will happen?” This level of uncertainty combined with Moore’s law of how fast technology advances should cause politicians and policy makers to sit up and pay attention in order to make plans to mitigate a potential large scale unemployment problem and the ramifications that come with it. If developed economies are to progress onwards in a sustainable way then I believe that the technology unemployment issue should be monitored very closely.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Briefly I have highlighted some of the nuances of the technology unemployment problem. Advanced and autonomous machines are in some sectors taking the jobs previously performed by humans resulting in higher levels of unemployment. Certainly new jobs will arise when old ones are destroyed but we also have to consider the speed at which old jobs will be destroyed since technology advances exponentially. This means that during the transitional stage <b>too many people may be made unemployed at once </b> which would could cause a massive strain on societies of the future. Hence this is a pressing issue.
</p>

<p>
In defense of my argument I have attempted to marshal evidence in the form of claims from various labour economists and academics, data sources and university programs which aim to investigate the relationship that advances in technology could create an unemployment problem in the future.
</p>

<p>
What are the policy implications of this? They could be massive, depending on the size of the blow technology lands on employment. On a macro level with increased unemployment we could see increased crime, less income per person, higher rates of depression, more poverty, and in extreme cases complete political upheaval as seen in the case of pre-Nazi Germany when unemployment rates were as high as 30%. However we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Advances in technology on the whole should be embraced since there are many positive aspects that come with it, and ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and machines as the main factor of production in economies should be sought after.
</p>

<p>
This situation reminds me somewhat of the one faced by Adam Smith in the mid-18th century who saw the gains to be made by switching from a paradigm known then as Mercantilism to the one which we currently operate under called Free Trade. He proposed a radical new way in which economies should be structured in his seminal work the Wealth of Nations which was arguably the most influential book in the world for raising the global standard of living.
</p>

<p>
The potential responses to the technological unemployment problem can range from as drastic as an entire paradigm shift such as that which occurred in Smiths day to simply investing heavily in education and facilitating as much as possible organizational innovation to prepare those who will have to change employment sectors quite rapidly. I do believe we are approaching a transition into an economy that is very productive but just doesn’t need a lot of human workers. If this issue coming from the tech industry is not preemptively planned for by policy makers and politicians today, then it will make this potential storm of unemployment a lot more difficult for industrial societies to ride out!
