I made it through week 2 of Phase 1! I feel so much better about my general understanding of the course now that I had the weekend to catch up on exercises.

<h1> Technical Learning </h1>

<h2> Suduko </h2>

Over the weekend, I rewrote the Suduko challenge by myself in OOP. I was able create the entire board of 81 cells where each cell was an object, which knew what number it contained, it knew what row, box and column it belonged too (I logged it's x and y coordinates). I wrote the whole program and it worked but when it solved a board, the breakcase wasn't specific enough and so it filled in a semi-filled board but it didn't keep to the Suduko rules of having only 1-9s in each row, box and column. I was still happy with how much I learned in the process. I plan on refactoring it this week too.

I got some practice with the ternary operator.

I learned that you can print a very nice string the console in ruby, if you use this operator "<<-" I printed a nice suduko board with the following code.

{% highlight ruby %}

string = <<-BOARD
     Sudoku #{number}
              #{solve}
      +-------+-------+-------+
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      +-------+-------+-------+
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      +-------+-------+-------+
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      | X X X | X X X | X X X |
      +-------+-------+-------+
              #{}
    BOARD

    puts string

{% endhighlight ruby %}

I learned that when mapping one set of values to another sub! can be useful since each value will be subbed with the corresponding value. gsub is a global sub which isn't as useful, when doing a one for one map.

(I still want to fix this on Monday though so that my program can solve the first 5 boards, I'll this blog posted if I fix it!)

<h2> Bistro Challenge </h2>

I learned a lot more about CSV and MVC with the Bistro challenge this weekend. I wrote a program which dealt with a bistro. I got an appreciation for making sure that methods and classes have single responsibilities.

I also wrote separate files for the MVC.

I wrote over a CSV file with

{% highlight ruby %}
CSV.open(filename, 'wb') do |row|
row << [array of headers]
@object_array.each do |obj|
row << [obj.property, obj.property, obj.property,]
end
{% endhighlight %}

The command $stdin.gets.chomp is very helpful to get input from the user from the terminal and then store that input in an array, which I later turned into a hash, to add an object to the array_object and then wrote over the CSV file to add the new object to the file. The code for $stdin.gets.chomp looked like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def user_input_add
    user = []
    puts "Please add recipe ID"
    user[0] = $stdin.gets.chomp
    puts "Please add the name of the dish"
    user[1] = $stdin.gets.chomp
{% endhighlight %}

Another great thing I got from this exercise was that the code was much cleaner and easier to write and understand when I instantiated a model and view object in the controller class. I then made a method run, in the class which I used to call methods on objects in other classes. This allowed my MVC too really have unique and sepearated responsibilities. I really loved this challenge I feel like I learned so much from it!


<h2> Phase 1 Assessment </h2>

I also completed the phase 1 assessment and made all testes pass. This was a big confidence boost. It seemed much easier too although it was the second time I redid the test to make sure I knew the material. I got better at reading rspec and learned to spot my errors from the rspec tests. I am now even more convinced then ever that rspec is how I will test all my code in the future as opppsed to DBC driver test code, which I had been using before hand.

I also used the scan method to find characters in a long string that weren't a blank space like so:

{% highlight ruby %}
string = "orange tree"
string.scan(/\S/)

=> ["o", "r", "a", "n", "g", "e", "t", "r", "e", "e"]
{% endhighlight %}


<h2> Boogle </h2>

I attempted to write a boogle game that could work search the board for any word. I'd say I solved about 40% of the problem. But I stopped working on it, since it was getting late and I realized that I would have had to write a pretty complicated recursive method to search the board for a whole word, across adjacent dice. A cool thing I learned from this challenge was how to populate the elements of a newly made array:

{% highlight ruby %}
DICE_LIST = Array.new(DICE.length) { |index| Die.new(DICE[index]) }
{% endhighlight %}

The |index| placeholder variable above acts as a counter which can start at 0 and end when it is done iterating through the newly made array elements. This is useful when populating a new array with values from another data pre-existing data structure.

<h2>POODR</h2>
I heard that some people in my cohort have read all 9 chapters of POODR. I finished reading up to chapter 5 this weekend. I want to try and finish the book this week. I read about flexible interfaces and duck typing:if it quacks like a duck treat it like a duck)

<h2> Cultural Learning </h2>

I went to the cinema with my class and we all watched Ex Machina! A movie about an AI called Ava who is created in a lab and is tested to see if she can be deemed intelligent enough to pass the Turin test of machine intelligence. It's the second time I watched that movie because I love it so much!

On Sunday I hung out with my two house mates Chris and Trent who are in gschool and we coded for most of the day in our house!
