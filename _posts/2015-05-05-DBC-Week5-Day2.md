This week is supposed to be the hardest of DBC. We learned JQuery today and tomorrow we are learning AJAX, with asynchronous calls. I'm feeling reasonably comfortable with the material, but I need to spend much more time on the keyboard tomorrow to ingrain what I've absorbed through lectures, reading and watching videos.

I have prepared well for Wednesday too. I plan on eating well, sleeping well tonight, and exercising tomorrow with a run at lunch time! Life is good, and I'm ready for tomorrow!

(I realize the blogs are getting fewer and shorter, the more intense the workload. I'll try and write another one either tomorrow or the next day depending on what I learn!)
