# Cultural Learning

This week I had a really interesting talk with Sherif, he's a teacher at DBC. His teaching credentials are pretty amazing, he has thought so many individuals, in different companies, across different continents how to learn and how to code. Over his time as a teacher he's consumed so many teaching resources and he's formed a pretty amazing view on the best practices and mindset one should adopt when trying to teach oneself a new skill.

I talked with him after our Friday morning check-in at DBC, and there were a few pearls of wisdom I discovered from that conversation with Sherif that I want to write down in case I forget. These are learning principals which you should always be coming back to so that you can really excel as a self-driven learner, how is able to learn a vast amount of new information or ideas quickly and effectively.

## Don't punish yourself

This is a huge learning technique that is so effective when you apply it with being mindful of your study. If you sit down to learn a new topic, whatever it may be, you should ask yourself: What do I hope to learn over the next 20 minutes? Then <b>be experimental </b> with how you wish to teach yourself about this topic. You could read blogs about it, you could read a book, you could watch a video, you could do a code along, you could skim material then experiment coding yourself. Either way you should guess what method will be the most effective for you and then you should do it for 20 minutes or so. Then at the end of the 20 minutes you should ask yourself:

<h3>"Was that effective?"</h3>

If it was effective then great, you'll feel energized that you've learned a new skill or have become more competent at an area of coding which is it's own reward. But the key thing is, if you feel like your current source of information (book/blog/video whatever) is ineffective at teaching you, then <h3>Don't punish yourself</h3> with that resource. You shouldn't try and fight it and plow on because that will sap your motivation and you'll also learn less then if you were to ditch the current source of information and try a new angle on the topic. Or if you want you can even switch topics to something which you are relatively good at in a newish domain. Then revist that topic you were having trouble with. But the lesson to abstract from this method of learning, is to not punish yourself with a source that is unhelpful for you in that current moment.

I looked back actually at my schedule for phase 0 in Dublin and it was so grueling and punishing now that I think about it. I would try and wake up at a certain hour to an alarm. I would then study for a block of time. Then eat. Then study again. I was trying to create a daily routine based on habits but I was really kind of punishing myself. I tried to linearily plow through resources like books. I would refuse to look at anyones code when I was trying to solve a problem, and struggle and punish myself with trying to get the answer to a point where I was getting no more value struggling on my own for the answer. I should have tried for 15 minutes, and if I wasn't getting it I should have tried to look at other peoples code and then rewrote the answer myself. Then tried later to see if I could rewrite the answer myself without looking at anyones code. Then I could have used the extra time freed up from not struggling by myself to go onto CodeByte or Code Wars and get a tone more value by trying out the questions online, looking at solutions and then rewriting questions myself.

If I was more mindful of my learning in phase 0, I would have cast of anyway of learning that was punishing and just gone for the most effective routes. Being in a college maybe I'm conditioned to try and punish myself with less effective learning resources or habits but after talking with Sheriff I am now vehement about taking the least punishing and most interesting/ valuable angles to learning a new topic. I am free to be completely experimental with my learning because I am aware in the moment of how effective a current learning resources is too me, and I am aware that I am free to try different avenues if I think the current route is too grueling!

## Be Mindful of your Learning

This is a big part of don't punish yourself so I mentioned then together. This has a bit to do with meditation which I like too. Being mindful basically means that you should develop the capacity for stepping back from your learning and observing your learning process instead of just plunging into things. You should ask yourself is this current method effective? Is what I've done for the last 20 minutes the best way to accomplish my goals? If not can I change my tactics for the next 20 minutes? You should be aware in the moment of how well you are learning and you should have like <h3>5 or 6 strategies</h3> for getting around a learning block that you may hit when trying to teach yourself something new. But it all comes from being mindful in the moment as you learn, and being aware of what is working for you and what isn't.

I think the capacity for being mindful during learning can be developed through meditation and careful reflection as you work, and checking in with yourself at stages through the day and observing is the current angle I'm taking effective.


## Regularly test your code to see if it works in a way that matches your expectations (Be a master bebugger)

This is a great learning principal in the domain of writing software. When you are learning a new technology it is quite probable that you will write code that will not function as you expect it too. So it's a good habit to regularly test to see if what you are writing functions how you expect it too. This is why I've really began to appreciate stuff like Chrome Dev Tools being open as I work. You can get live feedback on how your code is working. You can throw a debugger in your code which means that you can pause your code live in the browser and play around to see if everything is working as you expect it too. You can use binding-pry to test your ruby code. All of these debugging tools are like little Sherpas which are there to help and guide you to the top of the mountain, so it's wise to try and become familiar with debugging tools so that you can always test to see if the code you write is working like you expect it too.

Also when debugging the error message should always be read first to give you a clue about where your code is failing.

If the error message is unhelpful then you should use your debugging tools (debugger, curl, binding-pry). If you still can't find the bug, the process of elimination works well too. Pair your code down the a simplified version of itself and then start building it back up again to see at what point does it fail. When it's built back up and it fails then you've a clue about where your bug is living!

If I ever am stumped by a bug for more then 10-15 minutes I will try to view it as a piece of feedback that my debugging practice needs to be honed.

## Adopt a curious and playful mindset when learning a new topic.

This is another great tip from Sheriff, but you should always be curious and playful when learning as that's when you can learn the most. It's way easier to get into this mindset too when you do not punish yourself with difficult learning resources and when you are mindful about how you learn. You can cultivate this mindset by freeing yourself to study things that are interesting to you through aural/oral/kinesthetic channels that you enjoy.

Another great way to keep this mindset of play and curiosity and energy going is to take a break from your work every few days. This will allow you to come back much stronger then next day and more hungry to learn.

## Educate yourself like a Sine Wave!

When you learn a new topic, you should try and spend like 30 mins to an hour on the areas which you are most comfortable with. Dave Hoover in his book Apprenticeship Patterns called this "retreat into confidence". You should start at something which you can do with relative ease in your new domain. Then it will feel like there is lightening shooting out from your fingers. After 30 minutes or so you should use all of this momentum you have gathered up, to then turn towards the more technical side of what you are doing. Maybe in the context of rails after feeling like a boss generating a framework very quick through scaffolding, you could then switch your attention deliberatly into the config files, or the rake file and try to understand how the whole framework is pieced together.

This use of momentum at the start of a learning session which then is deliberately switched into something more technical or abstract or higher level is a great learning strategy too. You could help gather momentum by starting with a cheat sheet of new effective terms and trying them out, and seeing how far you can get with basic commands. Starting something cold can be demoralizing, so you should build up momentum and get energized first!



Technical Learning

I had a great lesson on UNIX commands on Friday too, here are some of the things we learned:

<ul>
  <li>ps</li>
  Which means process status and shows the processes which are running in your terminal.

  <li>grep "term"</li>
  Grep is a file pattern searcher. It looks through files for a certain term, or with pipes you can use grep to search the input for a certain term.


  <li>awk  {print $1}</li> is used for tabular data. (data which looks like it's in a table). You can use the print $1 to print out the first row.

  <li>man "command"</li>looks up what that command does.

  <li>echo</li> Writes arguments to the standard output.

  <li>Control A</li>
  Goes to start of the line.

  <li>Control E</li>
  Goes to the end of the line.

  <li>Control U</li>
  Deletes the whole line.

  <li>Control Y</li>
  Brings back a line you just deleted.

  <li>Control P</li>
  Previous command

  <li>Control R</li>

  <li>Control G</li>

  <li>Control W</li>
  Deletes a word at a time

  <li>Command !!</li>
  Useful for running the previous command with something put infront of it


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I've only two more weeks at DBC left. I'm going to try and live them as perfectly as I can. Being happy as I learn, sleep and live! Hopefully I'll have more time to blog in the future too!
