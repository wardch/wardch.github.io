<h1> Technical </h1>
Today I learned about SQL, Schema's and I took a mock assessment at DBC too gauge how comfortable I was with the material. I'd say I performed to about a 6/10 of what I can understand. However understanding the material through passive reading, is different from understanding the material to the point of writing applications fluidly and freely. Today was a bit of a wake up call in that regard. It made me appreciate more then ever, the importance of time on the keyboard, typing applications and practicing the principals that I've heard of in books, lectures and videos.

In SQL and with Schema and databases I learned a one to many relationship can be described as one row, having many rows in another database. A many to many relationship needs a table to join the ID's of two different tables together so many rows can be mapped to many other rows of two databases. This image helps clarify what I learned:

I also learned about the match operator in Ruby

{% highlight ruby %}

'hello' =~ /l/ # => 2

{% endhighlight %}

The match operator scan's a string that you give it, and it takes a RegEx. The RegEx if it finds the letter or word it is looking for will return the index of that word in the string.

I also learned about the ||= operator in Ruby. It's the equivalent of saying


{% highlight ruby %}

a || a = b

{% endhighlight %}

Where if a is logically false or nil, then a is equal to b. This can be useful if sometimes a will be false, so we can set it to a value that we know will be true.

I also learned that to sub out the white space characters in a string you can type:


{% highlight ruby %}

string.gsub!(' ','')

{% endhighlight %}

The majority of the day was spent first doing the self assessment, and then for the remainder learning SQL commands like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, DESC/ASC etc. Then understanding the mapping of one to one, one to many and many to many relationships in SQL.

<h1> To do list for the weekend </h1>
This weekend there are some challenges I'd like to redo to get some more time on the keyboard writing code. I'd like to do:

<ul>
  <li>Make all tests pass in self-assessment</li>
  <li><strike>CSV video and Tuesday challenge</strike></li>
  <li>Sudduko (rewrite) guessing algorithm</li>
  <li>World's simplest browser</li>
  <li>Web scraper</li>
  <li>Bingo (Jacks awesome solution), maybe just read it though</li>
</ul>

<h1> Cultural Learning </h1>
I went to yoga and had lunch by myself today in the sun and I felt so much better about the mock assessment. I felt much less stressed after some alone time + yoga! My bike broke on the way home from DBC which sucks but what can ya do! Looks like I'll be riding the bus for the foreseeable future! Bon nuit!
