This is a guide that I created off the top of my head one evening having just finished DBC a week or two before hand. The theme of this guide is advice that I would give to an incoming DBC boot, starting off on Day 1 of phase 1. I started thinking of different pieces of advice I would give, and it ended up being a 29 bullet point document.

If you're an incoming DBC boot reading this during phase 1, some of the tips wont make sense to you until you advance through the upcoming phases. Some of the advice even surrounds the job hunt. To make it easier to use this guide, I'll try and divide my tips into sections based on the different DBC phases. That was when you enter a new phase, you can reference this guide again, for tips that will make sense as you learn the content taught during the phase you happen to be in! Without further a due, here's my advice to survive and thrive at DBC!


<h1>Phase 1</h1>
<p>Phase 1 is always going to be crazy and stressful at the start. But you'll find you get better at managing your own stress, which is a skill worth developing by itself. Here's some tips worth knowing from phase 1 onwards:</p>

<ol>
<li>LEARN HOW TO SELF CORRECT. This is so important. It applies to all 3 phases and beyond. The more new technologies I learnt in different phases the more I appreciated the importance of quickly identifying the tools you will use to unstick you from a jam while coding. You'll waste a lot of time stuck that you could have spent learning, if you get good at self correcting. So first you should look at the terminal whenever your code doesn't work. Read the error message aloud. Identify the line number. Then a great principal I found while debugging, is to start extremely simple by commenting out all of your lines in whatever you are working on, then slowly start p-ing things out. That means writing puts or p followed by whatever line of code you want to examine, and checking the terminal to see if it's output matches your expectations. Doing this in small increments is a good way to track down bugs as you'll find that point of departure between how you expect your code to function and how it is really functioning. <b>If in doubt P it out.</b> And more generally "learn to self-correct."  </li>

<li>Be experimental with your learning.</li>
</ol>

As a caveat, I want to refrain from being too dogmatic about what you should and shouldn't do at DBC to get the most value out of your experience. In fact one of the biggest tips I could offer is to be experimental with regards to what works for you. For example, I tend to benefit from a code-along video when learning something new. You may benefit more then I do from skimming through books, or listening to a podcast. The key is to be mindful about how you learn, constantly ask yourself "was what I just did for the last 20 minutes effective?", if it was keep on doing it. If it wasn't change the source of information you are using.

<h1>Phase 2</h1>

<h1>Phase 3</h1>
<p>During phase 3 (before final projects) you get a chance to be more independent with regards to your own learning. You'll find that you have a little more breathing room to explore whatever you are interested in when compared to phase 2 when you were guzzling from the DBC firehose of information! I suggest using your time to recover if you need it, or take on more work outside of the challenges if you feel like you have the energy. Either way during phase 3, you will have more time then in phase 2 to do whatever you like and it's good to be aware of that going into the phase!</p>

<ol>
<li>Do Michael Hartl's famous (and free) <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book"> rails tutorial.</a> I would recommend trying to go at a fast pace, skimming where possible since the tutorial is quite lengthy. I also used GitHub instead of BitBucket like he suggests at the start. This tutorial will give you a very good grounding in rails though if you can try and complete as much as possible before the final projects. Plus it's a code-a-long tutorial where you build an app similar to twitter using rails. Having that twitter app on your GitHub is something you can show off to prospective employeers too as a rails app you built at DBC, in addition to whatever you make during your final 10ish days at DBC. </li>
</ol>
