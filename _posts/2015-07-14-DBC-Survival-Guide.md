This is a guide that I created off the top of my head one evening having just finished DBC a week or two before hand. The theme of this guide is advice that I would give to an incoming DBC boot, starting off on Day 1 of phase 1. I started thinking of different pieces of advice I would give, and it ended up being a 29ish bullet point document. As a caveat I would say that not all of these tips will be effective for everyone, but I thought that they were helpful enough for me to want to write them down and pass them on to incoming boots about to run through the crazy, weird, fun gauntlet that is DBC!

If you're an incoming DBC boot reading this during phase 1, some of the tips wont make sense to you until you advance through the upcoming phases. Some of the advice even surrounds the job hunt. To make it easier to use this guide, I'll try and divide my tips into sections based on the different DBC phases. That way you can reference this guide again, for tips that will make sense when you learn the content thought during the different DBC phases.

 Without further a due, here's my advice to survive and thrive at DBC!


<h1>Phase 1</h1>
<p>Phase 1 is always going to be crazy and stressful at the start. But you'll find you get better at managing your own stress, which is a skill worth developing by itself. Here's some tips worth knowing from phase 1 onwards:</p>

<ol>
<li>LEARN HOW TO SELF CORRECT. This is so important. It applies to all 3 phases and beyond. The more new technologies I learnt in different phases the more I appreciated the importance of quickly identifying the tools you will use to unstick you from a jam while coding. You'll waste a lot of time stuck that you could have spent learning, if you get good at self correcting.

A good first step when self correcting is to first look at the terminal whenever your code doesn't work. Read the error message aloud. Identify the line number. Then a great principal I found while debugging, is to start extremely simple by commenting out all of your lines in whatever you are working on, then slowly and incrementally start phasing lines back in to your code, while p-ing things out. That means writing puts or p followed by whatever line of code you want to examine, and checking the terminal to see if it's output matches your expectations. Doing this in small increments is a good way to track down bugs as you'll find that point of departure between how you expect your code to function and how it is really functioning. <b>If in doubt P it out.</b> And more generally "learn to self-correct."  </li>

<li>Binding.pry! This is a similar theme to the previous point but binding.pry deserves it's own bullet point. During your first week, ask a teaching assistant how it works when you are stuck on a problem. It's a debugging tool which if you invest a small amount of time becoming familiar with, it will save you way more time in the long run tracking down bugs!</li>

<li>Be experimental and 'mindful' with your own learning. In college and high school I was kind of trained to find a thick text book and start on page 1 and just linearly plough though it until I finished the book. I sort of cringe at how I would punish myself with this style of learning having now completed DBC. I think one of the best things you can do is to become experimental and mindful of your own learning. When you open a book, or watch a video or whatever ask yourself "what am I hoping to be able to do in the next 20mins". Then after 20 mins ask yourself, was that good? Was it effective at achieving my goal for example of understanding a basic AJAX call? If it was then keep on doing it. If it wasn't then stop punishing yourself and just find a different way to learn what you want to learn. (I can't resist giving a shout out to code-along videos though, I found them highly effective at learning whatever it was I needed to know!)</li>

<li>Learn by Doing. I believe to get really good at call of duty you need to play a ton of call of duty. Reading about COD isn't the same as playing it. It's the same deal with coding. I think the best way to learn, is just time on the keyboard instead of reading/watching videos etc. Videos and books are useful too, but I just think you get the most return on your investment by actually trying to write code yourself. Plus it will shatter any illusions of competence you may have been under through reading a book and thinking your understand the topic being explained. If you can code what you are trying to learn, then you'll understand it more deeply then just reading or watching a video.
</li>

<li><a href="https://talks.devbootcamp.com/">DBC Talks</a>, are a great resource when used with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en">chrome speed attachment</a>. You can set the speed to whatever you want and watch a talk on a subject you may be struggling with. Some people would watch videos in the evening, on a topic that we would be covering the next day. If you set the speed right on the video you could squeeze in a 30 min video some evenings, watching a video about what you will cover in lecture the next day!</li>

<li>Skim for breadth not depth. It's better to race through a book skimming and being content with only 60-70% comprehension then to rabbit hole consistently on one thing. Developing the skill of skimming a book and understanding it's message or it's gist will expose you to a lot of new vocabulary and ideas that you might not full understand but at least you will have seen before when it's time to learn them in depth. </li>

<li>Get good at playing with code and testing your assumptions with IRB. If you are not 100% sure how a ruby method works, open IRB and test it really quick. This goes back to the point about learning through doing as well. Getting fluid in the console using IRB will help you learn new unfamiliar ruby methods. </li>

<li>Get good with UNIX (your terminal). Here's some quick tips:
  <ul>
  <li>control + A = start of the line</li>
  <li>control + E = End of the line</li>
  <li>control + U = Delete the current line</li>
  <li>hit up twice = Brings back your previous command.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Become a shortcut ninja. A guy in the cohort below me had a goal to touch the mouse as little as possible while coding. It's a good goal, you'll get much faster at writing code if you can use <a href="http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html">Sublime ShortCuts</a> effectively.</li>

<li>Get close with your cohort and embrace and genuinely encourage each others enthusiasm and drive to tackle challenges each day. Simply put, coding is way easier and funner when you're having a good time. And teaching others can be so fun and benefical for both parties if both people are super enthusasitic. EVEN IF YOU BOTH DON"T KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING! I found pairing occasionally frustrating at the start of DBC, because I didn't like a situation where both my pair and I didn't know what we were doing. But the more time you spend at DBC, you'll probably begin to notice the more pleasant the pairing sessions are becoming because eventually everybody builds up a base knowledge of how ruby works in addition to learning ways to self correct themselves.

This means that at least there is momentum the whole time during a pairing session and then they start to become really fun. Become tight with your cohort and pair and you'll have way more fun at DBC and learn much more! Here's the highly photogenic 2015 SF Pocket Gophers having fun going to see Ex-Machina together!

<li>Yoga was my life line at times! (So San Francisco I know!) I loved yoga, just saying it put me in a really good mood. Go hard at the Monday one and you'll feel amazing all day, I found it much easier to enter a calm and alert mental flow state after yoga! I also even think I enjoyed pairing more. Yoga 2 times a week will keep you relatively balanced. I'd recommend doing it for the 9 weeks. If not then find another form of exercise. I just to run sometimes too during lunch to the top of Coit tower, which also helped me decompress. Ginnie Martin got me onto that. </li>

<li> Sleep is key. In the pre-phase 0 material, DBC recommends taking an online course called "Learning how to Learn". There is an interesting section of the course dedicated to sleep. Barbara Oakley says when we sleep knowledge that we learned during the day is more deeply assimilated into the brain as new information is compared with pre-exisiting neural pathways from different skills or knowledge which we already knew.

So you actually wake up with a deeper understanding of what you learned the previous day which is incredible, IF you don't skimp on sleep. And you also wash away neurotoxins which build up in the brain during the day through sleeping as well. I'm a big believer in the importance of sleep, you'll feel better and be able to learn more. Id say shoot for minimum of 7:30, ideally 8+ hours sleep a night. It may seem like it's taking away from coding time but in the long run you'll be able to learn more.
</li>

<li>Elimate blue light before bed! Studies have shown that if you stare at a computer screen or phone which emits "blue light" an hour or less before you sleep, you won't sleep as deeply or as well.

I'd recommend getting "Flux" for your computer. It's a program which eliminates blue light from your computer screen before you go to bed. Now some might call this extreme, but in the blue light hating hysteria I purchased a orange pair of coding glasses online from Amazon. I like them for late night coding. Plus I guess you could say it's a pretty chill lookâ€¦ anyway

<li> Super Ego attacks. They are real. It's okay. You should try and foster self-awarness when you are mentally criticizing yourself. I got super stressed on day 2 of DBC phase 1 then after an evening engineering empathy class, I calmed down and told my inner critic "Relax and breath, don't be so harsh on yourself and try to be more light hearted and curious with your own learning." It really calmed me down a lot, being aware of my own super ego. I hope that you get to deal with your own super ego in a healthy way too, because managing stress in a holestic way is a pretty great skill!
</li>

<li>Standing desks. For those of you that are health conscious this is a very interesting read that I just read after DBC, but I kinda wish I'd read before at phase 1! <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/02/medical-researchers-have-figured-out-how-much-time-is-okay-to-spend-sitting-each-day/">Stand Up!</a></li>

<li>I thought POODR was a little heavy, so was Ducketts CSS/HTML, JS book. Don't get me wrong they're great to read if you have the time. But if you feel like there is a lot of other stuff going on, then just try and skim chapters and their content and go for like a 50% comprehnesion plus. It's honestly better then knowing nothing. And if you don't have time to skim, just google around for a blog about what the essence of what POODR is about.</li>

<li>Get headspace, those 10 free meditations were like a lifeline for me at times at DBC when I could feel myself becoming sort of snappy with myself and others. I ended up buying the app and I would always find some peace when DBC was getting too stressful by dipping into the meditation room at lunch for 15 mins to become mentally happy and relaxed again!</li>

<li>If your in the SF location find <b>Sherif and talk to him about learning</b> and how to learn effectively. Sherif is an incredibly inspiring teacher who is extremely passionate about teaching. Even if you're not in his class, you'll get a lot of value by just walking up to him, introducing yourself and asking him for tips on learning. He'll be happy to share his thoughts and you'll leave feeling inspired and energized!</li>


<li>Everyday try and choose to <b>enjoy the craziness and confusion</b>! It's gonna be a slight emotional rollercoaster every day, but like sky diving you can either choose to be scared or excited as you jump out of the plane which is the start of phase 1! </li>



</ol>



<h1>Phase 2</h1>
<ol>
  <li>When you begin to learn Ajax, debugger is your best friend. Debugger is the sherpa that will guide you to the top of HTML mountain! I would only write a few lines of code before putting in a debugger to make sure that I had linked my JS file correctly, and that I was selecting the right element on the DOM. Here's how I set up my JS file, in preparation for an Ajax call:

  {% highlight javascript %}
  $(document).ready(function() {
    console.log("hello");
    bindEvents();
  });


  function bindEvents() {
    // Bind functions which add, remove, and complete todos to the appropriate
    // elements
    $('.form').on('submit', toAdd);
    $('.todo_list').on('click', '.complete', youCompleteMe);
    $('.todo_list').on('click', '.delete', youDeleteMe);
  };

  var toAdd = function(event){
      event.preventDefault();
      debugger;
      .
      .
      .
    };
  {% endhighlight %}

  First open up your dev tools in the browser. I then console log ('hello') and check to see if it appears in the console, if it does then I know that I have linked my JS file correctly. Then I write some JQuery which you will learn during phase 2, and in the very first function I write, I throw down a debugger. Which will pause the page in real time, and allow you to try and select DOM element using JQuery in real time. It's pretty amazing! Using debugger in conjunction with the JQuery docs will make for a much more pleasant learning of Ajax!!

  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Phase 3</h1>
<ol>
<li>You'll have more time then you had during phase 2, use it wisely! During phase 3 (before final projects) you get a chance to be more independent with regards to your own learning. You'll find that you have a little more breathing room to explore whatever you are interested in when compared to phase 2 when you were guzzling from the DBC firehose of information! I suggest using your time to recover if you need it, or take on more work outside of the challenges if you feel like you have the energy. Either way during phase 3, you will have more time then in phase 2 to do whatever you like and it's good to be aware of that going into the phase!</li>

<li>Do Michael Hartl's famous (and free) <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book"> rails tutorial.</a> I would recommend trying to go at a fast pace, skimming where possible since the tutorial is quite lengthy. I also used GitHub instead of BitBucket like he suggests at the start. This tutorial will give you a very good grounding in rails if you can try and complete as much as possible before the final projects which begin half way through week 2 of phase 3. Hartles Tutorial is a code-along tutorial too, where you build an app similar to twitter using rails. Having that twitter app on your GitHub is something you can show off as well too prospective employers as a rails app you built at DBC, in addition to whatever you make during your final 10ish days at DBC. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Phase 4: Carrer Week</h1>
<ol>
<li>For career week I recommend using this awesome resumÃ© making website called <a href="http://creddle.io/">creddle</a>, I made mine on it and it comes out beautifully, one employer at a meet up I went to just goes "damn thats a nice resumÃ©" when I handed the sheet to him haha. You enter the content and it automatically formats it for you and offers your different themes.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
That concludes my tips for DBC. I hope they were useful. If you completed DBC, and think there are more tips that I should add, shoot me and email at charlieward18@gmail.com and I'll add it to this blog post. I hope you love DBC as much as I did, it's an incredible challenging journey of self-growth and fun!
