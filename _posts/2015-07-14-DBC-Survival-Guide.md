This is a guide that I created off the top of my head one evening having just finished DBC a week or two before hand. The theme of this guide is advice that I would give to an incoming DBC boot, starting off on Day 1 of phase 1. I started thinking of different pieces of advice I would give, and it ended up being a 29 bullet point document.

If you're an incoming DBC boot reading this during phase 1, some of the tips wont make sense to you until you advance through the upcoming phases. Some of the advice even surrounds the job hunt. To make it easier to use this guide, I'll try and divide my tips into sections based on the different DBC phases. That was when you enter a new phase, you can reference this guide again, for tips that will make sense as you learn the content taught during the phase you happen to be in! Without further a due, here's my advice to survive and thrive at DBC!
