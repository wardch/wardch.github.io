The martial art of Brazilian Ji Jitzu takes about 10 years to become a master black belt but it's a life long journey of learning. The same could perhaps be said for learning how to code.

These seemingly unrelated crafts actually have a surprising amount in common. In September of 2014, I took up both BJJ and computer coding at the same time. I was and still am a novice in both domaines. But as I learned both crafts I began to notice effective patterns for learning for both of my passions. Let me show you what I mean by first explaining how someone learns the martial art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

<h2> How you Learn Ji Jitzu </h2>

So in BJJ when you first start, before you can start to be creative with your movement and before you can start moving around from position to submission with ease, and escape tight spots while focusing on your next move you first need to get a grip with the basics. The basics are just the movements you will be repeating again and again and again as a beginner, and when you start you will not know these basic movements as muscle memory yet and therefore they will take up almost all of your conscious mental focus and energy to perform.


As a beginner in BJJ long before you start mastering the flow of moves which might lead to a highly technical submission like the “gogoplata”, you will first need to master the scenario of trying to escape from being fully mounted. Or escaping from someone dominating you in side control. You find yourself in similar positions regularly as a beginner because those who are better then put you in inferior positions with ease which you must try to struggle and get out of.


The only effective, consistent and wise way to struggle out of these positions is by learning technique. Basic technique. This then provides you with enough of a platform to then get experience in other more dominant positions yourself. As you learn the basic escapes, you will then start finding yourself in positions for you to launch your own attacks. You might then start finding yourself in side control more and for the first time asking new questions to yourself  asking yourself like; how do I submit opponents from here, or how can I progress to a more dominant position?

As you progress in BJJ you learn the basics, then more advanced techniques, and then you find your own favorite area’s and develop and refine previous techniques while always trying to evolve your game. As a practitioner of BJJ you will also regularly be meeting with constant defeat. <b> To be successful in BJJ you must be able to embrace defeat as a tool for learning how to improve </b> this is one of the reasons I love BJJ. You begin to treat defeat not as a personal failure but as a necessary part of the learning process.


In this wonderful martial art you will run into trouble through your errant processes, and you will be tapped out a lot by more advanced and experienced practitioners. You use failure as a learning tool to evolve your process. Then next time you roll, having iterated over your game, you are less likely to fail and more likely to succeed. Iterating over your game and using failure as a tool for development is a concept for learning that computer programer know well.

BJJ is like a filtering process for different kinds of egos too. The sport is not a sustainable one for those with a fixed mindset; a kind of person who’s pride get’s hurt once they are tapped which prevents them from going out as a beginner and getting tapped again. This unwillingness to expose their ignorance is a road block to learning and as a result those people with a fixed mindset tend to get filtered out of BJJ and never make it past a few weeks in the sport.

Those with a growth mindset will thrive in the sport. As a beginner you will get tapped a lot, and I mean a lot. A person with a growth mindset uses failure as a tool for self improvement. A person with a growth mindset thinks to themselves when they are submitted “Oh damn I got caught there when I left my arm on that mat exposed; it’s okay though I’ll ask for advice from my rolling partner to improve and next time I’ll keep my elbows tucked to my body.” Hence my counter intuitive conclusion that it’s good for the mind to get submitted a lot in BJJ; it reminds you to nurture your growth mindset; it keep your ego humble, it makes you makes sure that you’re always willing to expose your ignorance and it makes you hungry to learn to get better! Failure can be harnessed as a learning tool.

Lastly in BJJ in order to learn a move you must watch in be performed, but more importantly you must physically try and perform it yourself a number of times to ingrain the movement into your muscle memory and to deeply understand it. It’s all well and good to watch 10 youtube videos on different submissions, but I quickly found that if you want a move in your arsenal, you must go out and drill it yourself. This reminds me of an adage in relation to computer coding too: We learn by building not by reading.

<h2> Learning in Computer Coding </h2>

Now let’s consider coding. In coding you will meet failure regularly especially as a beginner. You can choose to either embrace failure as a tool for learning and evolving you “coding game” or you use failure as an indicator that you are bad, you’ll always be bad, and you should be discouraged.

In coding you learn the basics (navigating sublime, the command line, the fundamentals of some languages etc.) before you move onto appreciating more refined aspects of the craft like engineering principals. You must learn the basics first though as a beginner, just like you must learn the basics in BJJ too.

In coding, you should always be hungry to learn and enjoy the learning process not the product. You shouldn't think "I need to have a good program" instead think I need to have a good process which will result in a good program. Similarly in BJJ you don’t think I need to submit the opponent, instead you think what string of moves and defenses can I employ in connected steps which as a result will lead me to victory.

In coding you learn through doing. (Learn coding the hard way) You can read and learn from books but to ingrain the actually code and understanding deeply into your brain, you need to actually engage experimentally with code, and embrace potential failure too and use it as a learning tool to evolve your game. Sounds a lot like learning BJJ through drilling moves!


In both domains you learn through doing, you learn through having good mentors, you can have a strong skill set by being both a generalist and a specialist in certain areas, and very interestingly in both area’s of work if you are passionate about the learning process you will find yourself slipping into flow and the part of your brain responsible for being aware of time will stop working as well and hours will fly by while you are so deeply connected with your craft that you don’t even notice that normally after this amount of time you should be hungry or sleepy. Flow to me is a sacred place though where I want to exist in all of the time. It’s not easy to get their all of the time though, but at Dev Bootcamp they really want you and your class to be in this state of mind all of the time! And right now, I feel like I am about to get into my computer coding vehicle for learning, and bomb down DBC’s autobahn for learning!
