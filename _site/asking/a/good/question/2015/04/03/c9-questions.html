    <h1> The Bare Essentials </h1>

<p>I think there are a few pretty good guidelines which one can follow when asking questions which will yield pretty good answers. I am a big believer in general principals as opposed to small details when approaching a problem, because often principals can encompass a wider range of scenarios. I can identity 5 principals for asking good questions, and the specific pointers for asking good questions are all nested in one or more of these principals.</p>

<ol>
  <li><h2> Be A Good Listener </h2></li>
   I think that to ask a good question one should try to be a good and eager listener. There's a number of reasons why this is an important trait for good question asking. The first is that sometimes you won't even have to ask a question if you were listening in the first place, because the answer may have been obtainable for you if you were in the moment and paying attention! I offer my opinion here a little bit reluctantly because sometimes people are listening or paying attention to the topic infront of them, but they simply don't understand what is going on anymore, in which case I always think it's so helpful for yourself and potentially for others to not be afraid to expose your ignorance and ask away!

   ![karl pilkington listening quote](/imgs/karl-pilkington.jpg)




   Another important reason why being a good listener will make you ask better questions is because you an really pinpoint the moment which you stopped understanding what was being discussed. Being a bad listener might result in asking an overly vague or general question which tends to result in general, non-specific answers which may not be of any great help to you!

   <li><h2> Actionable </h2></li>
   The second principal for asking good questions is to imagine that you want to perform an action, but you can't perform it because you don't understand a step in the process which would have otherwise taken you to the correct answer.When asking a question in person or online on a site like StackOverflow, it's best when describing the question initially to offer what the overal goal is of your question. This means that a wide range of alternative solutions can be suggested to you that you might not have thought of if you only offered a narrow scope to your problem. Sometimes people will think to offer you a solution from an angle you never even considered, this is why offering what the overall goal you want to achieve is important.

   It's a good idea in the first paragraph of your question to try and include the course of action which you took which didn't lead to the solution. Including your previous plan of action will first get you into the habit of not asking questions without trying to solve them yourself and as well it shows the person you are asking the question too that you made an honest attempt to answer the question which will be received well by any future answers.

   You should also mention any kind of constraints you face when you are taking action to solve your problem. If you can't use RegEx for you answer for some reason then definitely state it so that it rules out potential actionable answers which are of no relevance to your particular problem.

   Having an actionable question means making sure that you when you hear your response you will be able to implement the answer to take you to your overall goal. It's a good idea to frame a question so that you will receive actionable answers!

   <li><h2>Be Specific and Include Code</h2></li>
   I think this principal is one of the most important ones for asking a good question. A prerequisite for a specific question though is too first be a good listener so that you can pinpoint where you stopped understanding things. I'm guilty of sometimes asking questions which would be made much more effective if they were more specific. In the title of your question it's a good idea to try and distill you entire idea down to one sentence without losing the essence of the problem. In relation to code in general it's a good idea to, include which error messages you received, include the language you are dealing with, include the very specific problem you are running into. And if possible try and pose a question instead of a statement.

   A sharp good question is always best.

   The first paragraph after your title for your question, should just serve to offer more detail about your problem, what's the overall goal, the were the steps you took so far that didn't yield you the right answer. What were the error messages that you received? What were the methods and data types that you were dealing with.

   It's a good idea to include a code snippet too, to supplement your intro paragraphs about your question. Striking the balance between the right amount of code to display for your question is a skill too. Too much excess code makes it more difficult for potential answers to get to the bottom of your problem. Too little code though means that it may be difficult for answers to replicate the problem on their own computers and solve it. A good rule of thumb is to include just enough code and no more, so that someone seeing the problem for the first time could replicate the problem and answer it on their own computer without reading any superfluous code.

   <li><h2> Be Kind When Asking </h2> </li>

   There was an excellent video I watched in Dev Bootcamp which highlighted the difference between a demand and a request! When you request something off a person you are asking them a question where you can tolerate the answer being no! If you demand something from someone however, the implication is that you will emotionally punish the person who does not meet your demand.

   The principal of kindness if important when asking a question for a number of reasons. Firstly people will be more likely to offer you help when you ask for help as opposed to demand it, which is better for you the person asking the question.

  This is a little bit tangential from the discussion of how to ask a good question, but I really believe that the key to being happy and self confident is to be kind to other people too, and to strive to make others happy. Because the laws of giving kindness to others don't follow traditional economic laws, where if you give something away you will have less. Instead the more of your kindness that you give away the more happy you will be! It's lucky that our genes would have our actions set up to reward us like this: for being kind is to be selfish! (tangent over!)

  ![osho quote](/imgs/osho.jpg)



  So to ask a good question try and be kind, don't demand but request and you'll see a lot more helpful and positive answers coming you way!




   <li><h2> Don't be afraid to ask </h2></li>

   This last principal is just as important as the others, because if you choose to struggle without any intention of asking for help your odds of failing are likely to increase! Sometimes pride or doubt or fear of appearing stupid can stifle learning because people are afraid to ask a question which might expose their ignorance.

   Consider the previous 4 principals of good question asking: 1) listen well 2) frame the question so that the response can be actionable 3) be specific with what step of a process you are not understanding 4) be kind. If you follow these principals then you are never wrong to ask a question, in fact I think it's wrong for you not to ask a question. Because you deny youself a learning opportunity and others who may also be seeking for the answer for reasons which may include fear, self-doubt, reluctance to appear ignorant. But to be honest I think it's pretty liberating when you stop worrying about how other people might perceive you and just get down to deciding you are going to ask questions to help you self develop for your own benefit.

   I intended for this blog post to offer some insight into what makes a good question. Hopefully if you follow these 5 principals as guidelines for asking a good question, you will start to receive the answers which you are curious to hear!
