    <p>In this post I want to gain a higher level of self-awareness about how I learn, what are my strengths and what are my weaknesses.</p>

<h2> Results from the Gregorc test of thinking styles </h2>

<p>A test was designed by Anthoney Gregorc to catagorize people into the various kinds of learners that they are. Different people have different ways of approaching problems, and ideal environments within which they learn. There are four catagories, within which people may fall. Typically people will have traits belonging to a number of different catagories. My results are below:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>Abstract Random</td><td>56/60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Abstract Sequential</td><td>40/60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Concrete Random</td><td>20/60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Concrete Sequential</td><td>04/60</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<h2>Abstract Random Learner (56/60) </h2>

<p>These kinds of learners like to work in groups, they try to be sensitive to the emotions of others and they like being in the company of others.</p>

<p>They prefer to cooperate then to work solo on things. They are good listeners, and like to make those around them feel happy. The pick up on non verbal cues given off by people about how others might be feeling.</p>

<p>We (AR learners) need frequent feedback. For me I think I value feedback very highly, I feel like I could always do with more! Am I where I need to be? Is my work at the right standard? Am I on the right track?</p>

<p>Ideal feedback should be actionable and I want to take my result from the Gregorc thinking style test and incorporate it into my actions at DBC. I realized that I should make more of an effort to go to office hours and ask the tutors how am I progressing along, and could they offer any advice to point me in the right direction!</p>

<p>AR learners need an outlet for their creativity. This is also true for me when I consider what I like to do in my spare time. I like to read fiction, science and biographies. I like to create funny sketch videos with my friends. I like to chat to new and passionate people and travel to explore new ideas and cultures different from mine.</p>

<p>An AR learner needs a creative outlet to tap into their full potential. My take away from this test was to get creative with how I learn and write code, I should explore different daily routines and learning technicians to see what works best for me in furthering my education.</p>

<h2> Sources of Stress for an AR learner </h2>

<p>I have become aware through reading and life experience that I do not like to be alone for too long. I need human interaction to keep me happy and balanced. I’m okay with this realization that I need to have human contact though, it’s a nice way to be I think.</p>

<blockquote>
  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness - Desiderata by Max Ehrmann
</blockquote>

<p>I also do not like when people jump to negative conclusions. I always try and be positive, and  choose to find positivity in things. I’ve always had a naturally positive disposition. It was in my final year of college that I truly began to appreciate how reflection and meditation can really allow you to discover the source of positive and negative emotions within yourself. Once I realized how you can track down the source of your emotions it freed me to take real actions which would steer me to higher levels of personal happiness. I strive to be happy.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/zen-monk.jpeg" alt="zen monk" /></p>

<p>I also read in the book Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman that your working memory is affected by how stressed you are. There is an optimal level of stress, too much and your brain begins to shut down. To little and you can feel bored or unchallenged. In Emotional Intelligence Daniel Goleman argues through empirical evidence and statistical analysis a causal chain as follows: =&gt; stress =&gt; worse working memory =&gt; worse learning. To be a good learner is too not be overly (or underly) stressed.</p>

<p>Timing is a sources of stress for people who think like me too. Finishing one thing before starting another can be difficult. I find working within deadlines can sometimes be challenging for me, because I have the bad habit of trying to over read and research a topic instead of taking a more direct route and completing it sooner.</p>

<p>I’d rather delay putting out a minimal viable product (MVP), and instead try and put out an higher level of work closer to a dead line. This can lead to a huge build up of stress for me around deadlines, and so AR thinkers can suffer in this department. But the first step towards positive change is to be aware of your current state, I am trying to strike a more optimal balance between reading about a topic to become knowledgeable about it vs. getting work concerning the topic finished quickly.</p>

<h2> Abstract Sequential Thinkers (40/60) </h2>

<p>These kinds of thinkers need proof to back up assertions. They look for data, they look for the opinions of experts in fields before they draw inferences. This is exactly how I think actually, before I form an opinion on something I like to look at the history of the topic, I ask what are expert’s opinions, what does the data say, and does the data support what I happen to observe?</p>

<p>AS thinkers like to create things which solves a need, or makes a system run more effectively or smoothly. This sounds a lot like an entrepreneur. Which was what I believe myself to be. Creating to solve a need, that’s when I’m myself! That’s when I can slip into a state of flow!</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/level-of-flow.jpg" alt="flow char" /></p>

<p>Reading about how I like to create to solve a problem and about how I like to work with people and their emotions made me think maybe I should perhaps go into the field of social entrepreneurship. Combining emotional awareness as an abstract reasoner with the creative problem solving of abstract sequential thinkers.</p>

<p>Again apparently these types of thinkers do not like to be rushed while working, they like to explore all of the facts before acting. This set off a mini-alarm in my head. In both of my learning styles, the issue of time management was brought up. I am now even more aware of how I am going to manage my time and approach my work then ever.</p>

<h2>What has been the biggest struggle for you so far at DBC? </h2>

<p>The biggest struggle for me thus far has been, getting work done quickly. I seem to allow the work to expand to fill the time I have.  I find that I’ll go on tangents or down rabbit holes with my work and suddenly I’ll get less done then I had hoped! If I could nail down the issue of getting work done, within deadlines that I set myself maybe I’d feel a lot better and get the same amount of work produced in a shorter amount of time. Apparently my learning style doesn’t like to be rushed or working within time limits, however a person with a growth mindset believes that with the right amount of effort, I can change my habits and the way I approach work. I strongly agree with this growth mindset theory. I need to adapt my approach to suit my learning style, and for week 4 at DBC I’ve tailored a schedule for myself to try and develop my deadline/timing weaknesses as an AR and AS thinker!</p>

<h2>What Can I Do to Strengthen my Thinking and Learning weaknesses and play to my strengths</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Rise Early</li>

I listened to a pod-cast and a news article this week about the merits of getting up early! A common denominator for a lot of successful people is that they tend to rise early! I can see my weekly routine this coming week being, every night make a to-do list the night before, and then get working on it the following morning. This means I can start working on things directly after breakfast and immediately fall into the habit of taking the shortest route possible for each challenge and produce and MVP as quickly as possible and in the process trying to tackle my weakness of over-researching/over-reading too much!



So learners like me need emotional support and nourishment to thrive, they like to feel positive and happy. I should perhaps to do something I like in the morning before I start my days work. I’d like to meditate, do yoga or exercise. This will allow me to go into my learning enviorment with a happy mindset, this frame of mind is important for an AR learner, thus playing to my strengths.



Waking up early at like 6/6:30am also means that you will have the morning to yourself. Other people's priorities will not interfer with yourself until you've been up for at least 5 hours! That's a lot of alone time to get work done! Being up in the morning also feels great too, there's a kind of peaceful electricity in the air!

<blockquote>Let me have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will not drink of this at the fountainhead of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some and sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket to morning time in this world - David Henry Theroux</blockquote>



When I wake up in the morning, drink a glass of water, exercise or meditate, eat breakfast and then begin my days work. I will try and "eat my frogs first", which means doing the harder things before the easier things. However studies have shown that you should try and begin your day doing any writing that you will have to do at some point during the day. The task of writing apparently focuses the mind and primes it for work later on in the day. So I will begin the day by doing any writing that needs to be done, and then code for the remainder of the day and take notes, trying to get through each challenge as swiftly as possible to again deal with my



<li>Use rewards to pull you towards your work</li>

Learning preferences: I like to be pulled towards my work, it's when I produce at my highest standard! I have an aural and visual learning preference and I also like to ask questions. This week I will try and play to my strengths. I will try and go to office hours at least twice, to ask questions. I will try and watch videos on material to help me absorb it and play to my strengths. I'll rewards myself for good work produced. After every study session of work that I finish, I will try to jot down what I just learned for a feeling of accomplishment.


<li> Becoming Aware of Entrances to Rabbit Holes </li>

We learn through building not reading is an adage that I like about coding. This week to help me take a more direct route with my work I will always be trying to solve a problem and read when I do not understand the theory, instead of reading a lot and then trying to solve the problem. When I do need to read before beginning to experiment with code I will time box myself and not go over that amount of time. This will force me to begin breaking the habit of not getting started until I feel fully prepared! Because we are always outside of our comfort zones, getting started without all of the information is just something I am going to have to embrace!
</ol>

<h3> To become self-aware makes you feel better!</h3>

<p>I already feel better about tackling the workload for next week, now that I’ve become more aware of how I am failing and how I can succeed! I’ve resolved to myself to get up early this week. I’ve resolved to be happy before I settle down to work. And I’ve resolved to spend less time in theory and side learning, and more time being direct with getting challenges done. Time to put my new work approach in action for this week!</p>
