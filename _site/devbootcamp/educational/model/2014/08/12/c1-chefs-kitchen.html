    <h1>Dev BootCamp vs The University. Which institution is better at teaching?</h1>

<p>In this post I discuss my take on the DBC experience, my impression of their model of learning, and my expectations for myself when engaging with this culture at DBC as well as my feelings about trying to rise to this challenge.</p>

<p>The first thing to note about these relatively new ways of educating people called the bootcamp model of education is that they are drastically different from the university in many ways, and I think that’s a positive thing in terms of furthering your education.</p>

<p>Hopefully through writing this blog for an imagined audience I will persuade people to consider the merits of the DBC model of education as an excellent template for teaching people new topics and stimulating effective, emotionally holistic and passionate learning.</p>

<h2> I really didn't like the Bell Curve! </h2>
<p>The Bell Curve stifles learning. Learning occurs at a quicker rate when peers share information they’ve acquired with their group.
This is one reason why the DBC model of learning can provide a learning curve that is far steeper then a university can. Let’s consider this premise: If there is a group of people who all have different level’s of information about a certain new topic and they choose to share information directly with each other then the group will develop and learn new information at a much quicker rate then if information was hoarded by individuals. If everyone was willing to share their understanding of certain topics then everyones absolute level of knowledge would rise. This is opposed to a situation which occures under bell curve learning where information is hoarded. Without the dreaded “bell curve” information would be even more free flowing amongst peers in the same group.</p>

<p>Generosity, being nice and sharing information is the DBC model of learning. If you learn a new more effective way of doing something, like a keyboard shortcut, or an effective way of understanding the differences between arrays and hashes then it won’t be long until you share your helpful information with someone and within a short amount of time that new knowledge will be shared by everyone within your cohort.</p>

<p>Furthermore by teaching a skill or concept is an excellent litmus test of whether you understand something or not. It shatters any illusions of competence you may be under. Through teaching you also deepen your own understanding. This DBC way of altrusitic learning not only is effective for helping everyone understand new ideas, BUT it also feels great too!</p>

<p>Now consider the universities way of teaching.
In the “bell curve” way of learning, information is hoarded because there are disincentives to share, which all students are aware of. The bell curve basically means that there are a finite amount of good grades to be given out for each class. So when the individual shares his work or learning with the group, the group will benefit at the individual’s expense. Hence learning through sharing is extremely limited in the university setting. In a large class room, sharing would typically occur between small cartels of friends, and that was sadly typically the extent of it.</p>

<p>Learning for everyone suffered, but hard working individuals maintained their good grades under the bell curve system.</p>

<p>But DBC says grades don’t have to be the only way to measure progress. In fact if grades were gotten rid of, and another system of feedback for the individual was put in place, then we could cast of the bell curve system of learning because a student will be compared to himself and not relatively to others. If the student is getting poor feedback they perhaps not advance to harder topics until instructors are certain that the student full understands their corse work. We can then stop hoarding information since we are not racing against other students, now it’s within everyones interest to start sharing as freely as possible. And a rising tide of knowledge lifts everyones boats!</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/boat-tides.jpg" alt="rising tide lifts all boats" /></p>

<p><i>This is a philosophy of education that DBC boldly pioneers.</i></p>

<h2> Feedback </h2>
<p>So the question is how can the individual know if they know the material well or not? That’s where feedback loops comes into play. DBC have a web application called “feedbackinator” where students who have worked with you will give you anonymous feedback on where your current strengths and weaknesses are. The feedback must follow the acronym of ASK. (Actionable, specific and kind.) You have a good sense of your understanding of the material through other students assessing your standards. You also get feedback from DBC tutors on your coding work, if the feedback is consistently bad you may be asked to leave the program, if your work is on track they suggest areas in which you may improve. The feedback model makes each student very aware of their own understanding and motivates each student to achieve for higher goals!</p>

<h2>Emotional development</h2>

<p>I think academic institutions are sometimes reluctant to admit that a great way to foster learning is to foster emotional development. Are you aware of what is preventing you from achieving your full potential. What emotional road blocks are in your way which you might not even be aware of!</p>

<p>In a university learning is often confined to a syllabus provided to you by a lecturer, and all of the courses resources are geared towards academic topics such as economics and political science etc. But the human brain needs to be happy and in a good place in order to not procrastinate, it needs to be aware of “how it is failing” in order to steer our actions to be more in line with our goals.</p>

<p>DBC recognizes the importance of increasing a student’s emotional intelligence, as this is a master aptitude for learning in general. Since I’ve started DBC I have taken a course called “Learning how to Learn” and I’ve read a book called Apprenticeship Patterns. I wish I had watched that video course and read that book before college. It would of made learning anything new so much easier. But at least I’ve read them now. And I delved into these “meta learning” resources because DBC appreciate that if one wants to maximize their learning potential they need to take advantage of the wealth of resources out there about learning best practices!</p>

<p>I’m excited to see my newly learned learning practices employed as I have to study new computer coding languages and concepts! The passion for education at DBC is infectious.</p>

<p>It’s very refreshing to see a new educational institution apply the best methods of teaching material to students as possible, especially after being in a university for 4 years. It makes learning new stuff fun when you are typing up stuff, working with a partner, watching a video made specifically for the task you are about to perform etc. This newer model of learning doesn’t just focus on reading (like university’s tend too) but you can learn through video’s, you can learn through talking to other’s online, and you can learn from working with others too. This caters to different kinds of learners.</p>

<p>The DBC model in my opinion is much funner and inspires much more passion and hunger to learn then if a student were just sitting in a large lecture hall listening to a professor apathetically teach you a syllabus that he hasn’t changed majorly in years. I should say though that in my university experience there are some passionate lecturers who did make honest attempts to try and make their student’s understand their material as well as possible. But there were also professors which gave the impression that the papers which they were working on were their number 1 priority, and teaching was just a formality which had to be done. My experience with Trinity College Dublin was that I thought progressive educational change like adopting new technologies into the teaching syllabus was very slow. Educational inertia was all to common, unlike the DBC model were change leading to improved teaching methods is embraced.</p>

<h2>My feelings about entering this educational model</h2>

<p>I feel cautiously optimistic. Excited. Slightly nervous. Inspired to work well and work hard. I plan on living in a tech house when I’m over in San Francisco too. This is a house where about 10-20 people from different coding bootcamps like HackReactor, DBC and HackBright will also be living. I’m feeling energized when I think about feeding off the drive, motivation and hunger to learn of my house mates! I think the DBC way of learning, which is share what you know generously is so more in line with my personality then the hoarding bell curve system. I can’t wait to get started!!</p>
