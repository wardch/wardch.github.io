      <h1>Stereotype Threat: The mental placebo pill, which when ingested causes people to under perform! </h1>

      <h2>Subject: Stereotype Threat</h2>

      <h4>15/03/2015</h4>

<h2> Stereotype threat </h2>

<p>
Let’s say there are two people that are average at spelling, Adam and Brian. If they are both given a spelling test at the university level but Adam is told a lie moments before the test begins.
</p>

<p>
The examiners tell Adam that they have performed a very similar test on all of his family members. Adam is falsely lead to believe that his family were found to be markedly below the average level of spelling for all of their ages. Now let the test begin. Despite this information being completely false, without looking at empirical data do you think there might be causation here between telling Adam a negative fact about his ability to spell, and then testing his ability to spell. Will Adam believe that he is a bad speller? Will the doubt in his mind effect his ability to spell?</p>

<p>
All of these questions and more come under the scope of stereotype threat!
</p>

<p>
Stereotype threat can range from people thinking that they belong to a group of bad spellers or bad drivers. It can be an elderly person worried that they’ll confirm a stereotype of not being mentally sharp. People can have these harmful facts explicitly told to them (like Adam in the example above) but more common is that negative stereotypes about a person’s group will seep into their consciousness from their environment as they grow up.
</p>

<p>
The result of absorbing this kind of harmful information can really hinder a person’s ability to do well at something. This fear of failure is increased when they have a spotlight shinned on them, such as during a test which is supposed to measure their competence at the very skill they believe that their group is stereotypically not good at.
</p>

<p>
Coming from a statistics background in college I always like to see if empirical evidence supports the underlying gut-feeling of a hypothesis before a theory can start winning me over as being true.
</p>

<p>
Steele and Aronson, two social psychologist wanted to test this theory of stereotype threat. They noted that throughout the 1990s the national college-dropout rate for African-Americans has been 20 to 25 percent higher than that for whites. Among those who finish college, the grade-point average of black students is two thirds of a grade below that of whites. Could this be like Adam believing he belonged to a group that couldn’t spell, that black students in college believe they belong to a group that doesn’t fair as well as whites in the University setting?
</p>

<p>
To test their hypothesis Steele and Aronson got two groups of students and told them that they were about to go through a test of their vocabulary, which would take an average person of their age far out of their comfort zone. Before the test the invigilators told students that this test was a measure of intelligence. This clearly raises the stakes somewhat. If you belonged to a group where you knew that statistically you had more of a chance of experiencing the prison system then going to college, you might think react to a test of your intelligence with anxiety, doubt and pressure and as a result a worse performance. This is exactly what happened. Black students did perform worse on tests when they were told those tests where a measure of their intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Very interestingly though when black students were told before the vocabulary test that it was supposed to be fun and challenging then the results of the two groups (white and black) were identical. This is where we begin to see how stereotype threat manifests itself. At the core of the theory is fear. And fear prohibits blacks from achieving highly. Fear that they will confirm a negative stereotype of a group that they belong to. This fear based under-performance is what is proposed by Steele and Aronson as being at the core of stereotype threat.
</p>

<h2>Placebo Analogy</h2>

<p>
Stereotype threat reminds me of taking a placebo in an experiment. For example there can be three groups in a test for cancer curing pills. The Group 1 takes the cancer pill, Group 2 takes a pill that looks like the cancer pill but just contains sugar, Group 3 takes nothing.
</p>

<p>
The results of having a placebo pill in an experiment can often look something like this.  Group 1’s people have a 20% reduction in cancer rates. People in group 3 have 0% reduction in cancer rates, but people in group 2 who took the sugar pills can have a 5% reduction in cancer rates. This is the placebo effect, they took a sugar pill and got less cancer because they thought they were taking a cancer pill.
</p>

<p>
This is like stereotype threat, your placebo which you have swallowed (maybe subconsciously) is that you belong to a group that isn’t good at the challenge facing you. This thought alone is enough to effect your results. It’s the placebo effect in action! A placebo which creates hope in a person taking a cancer pill, can effect their results positively. The same kind of correlation is true of stereotype threat. You take the mental placebo (a bad assumption about the group you belong to), you think negatively, you perform negatively.
</p>

<h2>My Limited Experience with Stereotype Threat</h2>

<p>
I am a young, mid-twenties, Irish, white male. If stereotype threat comes from a fear that the group you belong to isn’t capable of performing something well, then I wonder what is the opposite: where you have a belief that the group that you come from is capable of everything!
</p>

<p>
From my experience of traveling around Europe and living in France and America for extended periods of time I always found that the general feeling towards people coming from my strange little rain soaked Island is always warm, welcoming and interested! I look at the world of sport, of business, of technology and I see the Irish as an underdog punching way above their weight! I see them as humble (despite my previous sentence), down to earth people, who may have their flaws like all countries but are ultimately a kind and friendly people! However talking in generalities makes me somewhat uncomfortable (unless as mentioned above their is empirical evidence to match the claims!) because my direct experience is some what limited to the circles of people that I move in!
</p>

<p>
I believe that one of the best ways to remove stereotype threat is that you must not have a fear based mindset when encountering challenges which test you. Remove this habit of self-doubt and you’ll remove the root of the problem, which is that you think you are not good enough. Easier said then done though, I’ll admit but I think if a person recognized that the sum of their talents do not belong to a group, they belong to the individual.
</p>

<p>
If you are aware and hard working within your domain then confidence will begin to replace fear. But I’m not going to offer too much advice on a subject like stereotype threat that luckily I don’t have any direct experience with. Unless of course you count drinking too much as a stereotype threat, but that doesn’t bother me too much because every country drinks and plus who doesn’t want to known as a lovable guinness drinking rogue! Even Obama isn't afraid to indulge that Irish stereotype!
