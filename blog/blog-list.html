        <p> In this post I use the analogy of Russian dolls to describe recursion, the idea being recursion is just a function within a function within a function. Recursion reminds me of those little Russian dolls that are stacked within themselves. Or Matryoshka dolls as google tells me!
      For those who are unfamiliar, within each Russian doll is a smaller doll, until you get to the smallest doll of the set, which contains nothing. A recursive function in programming is a function which calls itself. It keeps on calling itself until it reaches it’s "base condition."" The base condition is a condition which says okay, the argument which we have feed into the initial function has been modified to match the base conditi

There were probably about 9 of us in total. We were all really close friends that hang out a good bit. I was really excited to bowl and try and learn the different techniques, I always thought it looked so cool when pros swerve the ball dramatically from right to left before they hit any pins!

        <p> For this cheat sheet we're going to go over Javascript prototypes.Javascript doesn't share classical inheritance in the way that Object oriented languages do (with classes, parent classes, child classes, etc.) Nevertheless, inheritance is still present in Javascript thanks to the concept of the 'prototype'. In order to follow DRY programming principles, Javascript has created a simple way to add, update, inherit, and lookup properties of linked sets of Objects. The mechanism that is used to perform all of these actions is the 'constructor' function, which relates to the JS Object's prototype.

        <p> It is useful to think of classes as factories for producing objects. You can choose what feature you would like each object manufactured from your class to have. You can bestow innate methods to each object created from a class, by defining methods within the class first. Let's run through a real world scenario for clarity! Imagine you owned a Pet store and you needed a way to keep track of all of your pets in your store which may have a lot of different values for their attribute such as weight, price, color etc. Then the creation of a class called Pet would help your endeavor tremendously.

        <p> The method group_by in Ruby is a pretty aptly named method. You'd use this method when there are a bunch of objects which you would like to organize into groups. For example let's say you have a list of 6 words and you'd like to organize those words into groups, based on the length of each word. You use the method "group_by" to form a hash, where each "group" contains words, and each group is unique, containing only words of a certain length! And that's group_by briefly explained, but my "words:example" ratio is getting alarmingly high, so I'll demonstrate how nice an enumerable method group by really is:

We can choose how many reptiles names we would like to store in the cabinet. When we open the cabinet up, there are an infinite amount of "slots" (or indexes) for us to store our reptile names. So we want to make our first entry into the cabinet with the word "turtle".

        <p>Relative positioning is relatively easy to understand! If you type in a css file: <br>

            h1 {
            position:relative;
            left: 50px;
          }

          It means that the elements between all of the h1 tags in your HTML file, will appear 50px to the left of where they would have appeared otherwise!

Simply put, "version control" really just means having multiple versions of your file saved, in a chronological order. To explain version control better, I think it's helpful to take the analogy of a character progressing through a level on a game.
