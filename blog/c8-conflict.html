      <h1>Reflections on Conflict: Bowling can be a heated affair! </h1>

      <h2>In this post I reflect over a previous conflict and consider how I learned from it, and what was it's source.</h2>

      <h4>27/03/2015</h4>

      <h2>
      Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
      </h2>

<p>
One night be and a big bunch of friends went bowling. There were probably about 9 of us in total. We were all really close friends that hang out a good bit. I was really excited to bowl and get better at bowling because it’s a pretty fun game. When we started bowling I thought it’d be a good idea to split the group into 3s so everybody could get loads of bowling time and we could chop up the 3s bowling after every game so everyone could bowl with everyone. Also we’re such good mates I figured splitting up the groups was no big deal since we all hangout pretty regularly anyway. I’ll admit too that I was an eager beaver when it came to bowling, and all of the waiting around in a game of 5 people could be fixed if we went in threes.
</p>

<p>
One of my best friends Chris, didn’t want to split up the group. And he reacted pretty confrontationally to the suggestion. We were both expressing our points of view, he didn’t want the group to be split up and I wanted to bowl more but I would only go ahead with splitting the group up if everybody else was as eager to bowl as me. Basically it was a suggestion that I would have gone along with if people felt the same way. I had no desire to force the issue. But a needless confrontation broke out instead. Chris got pretty heated at the suggestion and didn’t want to consider my point of view. Then it dawned on me that I thought Chris was angry at something that had happened earlier in the night, the source of the anger wasn’t coming from the suggestion of bowling in smaller groups.
</p>


<h2>
What was the source of the conflict?
</h2>

<p>
I heard at Dev BootCamp you shouldn’t offer feedback unless you are asked for it. To be honest I accepted this piece of advice as having merit without really understanding or considering the reasons why. But being aware of this “feedback guideline” I began to notice that in general people do receive feedback much more positively when they ask for it. Some people prefer the enjoyment of working out problems by themselves, and if you offer someone feedback before they ask then in a way you have deprived them of a learning opportunity to figure things out for themselves, which could get frustrating.
</p>

<p>
I really had to think this one out though, because I think I am always looking for feedback about a better or more effective way to do something. And sometimes I make the mistake of assuming that other people must feel the same way. During the bowling game I Chris was struggling to knock down much pins and recommended a different way to throw the ball to him (even though I’m a complete noob, although enthusiastic none the less). He didn’t receive the feedback well, and I could tell he was frustrated at receiving the advice which he didn’t ask for.
</p>

<p>
And then it clicked with me, that for certain people you should be careful with how you offer them feedback. Yes it can be kind, actionable and specific but if they don’t want to hear it, then you offering the feedback will be a source of frustration as opposed to help! Gauging whether someone wants feedback in the first place is actually an important skill too, as well as offering good feedback. It clicked with me, that if you offer someone feedback in an area where they are not doing so well, even though you can be well intentioned, it can be perceived by the person receiving the feedback as a clear and public proof that they are incompetent at whatever it is that they are doing. That conflict me and Chris later had about splitting up the group for bowling should have really been a conversation. But it wasn’t because earlier in the night I had made the mistake of offering feedback to a person who at that particular time didn’t really want to hear it. And I really appreciate Chris’s point of view to, it’s funner to work things out by yourself sometimes.
</p>

<h2>
What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
</h2>

<p>
When I analyzed what happened I felt better, since I realized Chris wasn’t being disproportionately confrontational for no reason at all. Rather he was reacting to feedback which I had given him early on in the night which I was unaware of at the time, was causing him feelings of indecency and maybe even embarrassment. I think on reflection over the conflict I was more aware or appreciative that one should be sensitive to how other people might be feeling before you send them feedback over something. There are no really rules about whens a good time either, you can almost tell if they want feedback if you are careful and sensitive to their state in the moment. But as a general guideline, perhaps don’t offer it as freely if people don’t ask.
</p>

<h2>
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
</h2>

<p>
The next day I called Chris up, and we hung out and I didn’t mention it with him explicitly. I may have told him that I was sorry for being so overly eager with my desire to bowl, but I didn’t offer a breakdown of how I later came to a conclusion that I thought he may have reacted confrontationally because of feedback I offered which he didn’t want to receive. If I thought that the dynamic between us was sour when we hung out that evening I would have brought it up. But I could tell that everything was smooth again when we were hanging out having a laugh.
</p>

<h2>
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
</h2>

<p>
I didn’t feel bad for wanting to bowl in fewer numbers so we could all bowl more. But if I could do it again I know for certain I would have been waaay  more sensitive to Chris (and other people in general) about how I offer then constructive feedback.
</p>

<h2>
What did you learn from this experience?
</h2>

<p>
I appreciated a fact that feedback can be well intentioned and kind, actionable and specific but not everyone want’s to hear feedback at all times. Sometimes it’s better to vibe the mood the person you are talking to is in, and if you really think the feedback would help them and if you think they will receive it well then by all means offer any kind, actionable and specific feedback
