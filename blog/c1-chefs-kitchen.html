      <h1>Dev BootCamp vs The University. Which institution is better at teaching?</h1>
      <h2>My take on the DBC experience, my impression of their model of learning, and my expectations for myself when engaging with this culture at DBC as well as my feelings about trying to rise to this challenge. </h2>
      <h4>08/02/2015</h4>
    <p>
      In this blog post I’d like to try and compare the DBC model of education to the more traditional models of education which I have been involved in for the last 4 years of my life, namely the university. I want to compare DBC with other institutions of education such as the university to highlight the differences in effective teaching methods that are applied in DBC but not the university, and as a result DBC offer’s a steeper learning curve to it’s students then a typical university.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hopefully through writing this blog for an imagined audience I will persuade people to consider the merits of the DBC model of education as an excellent template for teaching people new topics and stimulating effective, emotionally holistic and passionate learning.

    </p>

    <h2>The Bell Curve stifles learning. Learning occurs at a quicker rate when peers share information they’ve acquired with their group.</h2>
    <p>
        This is one reason why the DBC model of learning can provide a learning curve that is far steeper then a university can. Let’s consider this premise: If there is a group of people who all have different level’s of information about a certain new topic and they choose to share information directly with each other then the group will develop and learn new information at a much quicker rate then if information was hoarded by individuals. If everyone was willing to share then the whole group would learn a lot faster, then if everyone hoarded. If there was no reason to hoard information (the bell curve encourages hoarding which I will explain later) then information would be even more free flowing amongst peers in the same group.

    </p>

    <p>
      Generosity, being nice and sharing information is the DBC model of learning. You share what you have learned with others, and they share what they have learned with you. Everyone picks up skills, and in a way when one person learns a new helpful skill it will not be long until that skill permeates throughout the entire cohort, within a week everybody will have acquired this new and highly effective skill. Furthermore by teaching a skill or concept to someone, you in turn teach yourself, as any illusions of competence you have about the concept will be revealed. When you explain it to someone step by step, you’re understanding will be deepened too.

    </p>

    <p>
      Now consider what I call “the bell curve” way of learning. When I was in college too often I would witness student’s (sometimes I admit myself included) hoarding information from other student’s which would have advanced their knowledge on a particular topic. The reason for this hoarding of information and work is because there are disincentives to sharing due to the bell curve. The bell curve basically means that there are a finite amount of good grades to be given out for each class. So when the individual shares his work or learning with the group, the group will benefit at the individuals expense. Hence learning through sharing is extremely limited in the university setting. In a large class room, sharing would typically occur between small groups of friends, and that was sadly typically the extent of it. Learning for everyone suffered, but hard working individuals maintained their good grades under the bell curve system.
    </p>

    <p>
      But DBC says grades don’t have to be the only way to measure progress. In fact if grades were gotten rid of, and another system of feedback for the individual was put in place, then could everyone be more willing to share? This is a philosophy of education that DBC boldly pioneers.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the question is how can the individual know if they know the material well or not? That’s where feedback loops comes into play. DBC have a web application called “feedbackinator” where students who have worked with you will give you anonymous feedback on where your current strengths and weaknesses are. The feedback must follow the acronym of ASK. (Actionable, specific and kind.) Feedback on the standard of someones work is given not through grades, instead it’s given through your peers and mentors who code with you each week. This means that once you have some form of a metric to gauge your progress, the sharing method of learning will prove to be more effective then the “bell curve” method of learning. Everyone is helping each other out. Everyone is eager to share and teach others and passionately learn new things.
    </p>

    <h2>Emotional development </h2>

    <p>At Dev Bootcamp the whole syllabus points towards maximizing your learning potential during a short amount of time (18 weeks in total). So how do you maximize your learning potential? Well there are fields of study on the topic of “how to learn effectively”. Neuroscientists and researchers in education have identified numerous patterns and practical techniques that you can apply to hugely steepen your learning curve! Let me quickly reference a few great learning techniques that I am now aware of since I started DBC: Time boxing, ways to deal with procrastination, learning before bed time, promoting diffuse as well as focused learning, deliberate practice, learning by doing, memorization techniques, the importance of trying problems and learning through failure, the importance of recalling what you’ve done to cement your learning, and also creating flash cards (I was against this one for so long, but I’ve been convinced!)
    </p>

    <p>In a university learning is often confined to a syllabus provided to you by a lecturer, and all of the courses resources are geared towards academic topics such as economics and political science etc. But the human brain needs to be happy and in a good place in order to not procrastinate, it needs to be mindful and aware in order to notice how it is failing to learn and how better learning process could be employed. A student must be emotionally intelligent if he is going to sit down at a desk and focus intently and learn well in any academic study. Often college’s ignore the emotional intelligence aspect of learning. College’s also don’t teach student’s how to learn new information and understand new topics better. And therefore we see a wide variation of student’s in college ranging from the apathetic learners to the highly motivated and engaged learners in a course. There would probably be a higher level of passion for learning if people knew the best way’s to get into their study zone, if colleges made more of an effort to increase people’s emotional intelligence when teaching them subjects like science or the arts. </p>

    <p>
      DBC recognizes the importance of increasing a student’s emotional intelligence, as this is a master aptitude for learning in general. Since I’ve started DBC I have taken a course called “Learning how to Learn” and I’ve read a book called Apprenticeship Patterns. I wish I had watched that video course and read that book before college. It would of made learning anything new so much easier. But at least I’ve read them now. And I read them because DBC are so passionate about learning that they want to teach their students how to learn, they want their students to employ the best learning practices when grappling with new ideas and concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m excited to see my newly learned learning practices employed as I have to study new computer coding languages and concepts! The passion for education at DBC is infectious.
    </p>

    <h2>
      DBC is an agile institutions which can change and evolve quickly. Universities and secondary schools are sclerotic and slow to improve or iterate over their old ways.
    </h2>

    <p>
      One reason why DBC is able to be so effective at teaching though is because it listens to the feedback from student’s about the courses syllabus for improvements. DBC are quick to change things that are not working, and adopt novel subjects or ways of learning to see if they are effective. This experimental way of teaching is so effective, it’s like a laboratory where the educators can test what learning techniques work well and which ones do not. If they work well the new teaching method is kept, if it doesn’t work well the teaching method is abandoned.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a university though often the older practices of learning are not abandoned but clung too despite their inefficiency. In my university I thought there that there was definitely room for technology to be used more to help students learn their relative modules, but technology was underused. The lecturer lead model of learning, where a students learning is often crammed into the weeks surrounding two terms essays and an end of year exam just isn’t as effect as the DBC model which is quick to evolve and experiment with novel learning best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence again the stepper learning curve. It’s very refreshing to see a new educational institution apply the best methods of teaching material to students as possible, especially after being in a university for 4 years. It makes learning new stuff fun when you are typing up stuff, working with a partner, watching a video made specifically for the task you are about to perform etc. This newer model of learning doesn’t just focus on reading (like university’s tend too) but you can learn through video’s, you can learn through talking to other’s online, and you can learn from working with others too. This caters to different kinds of learners.
    </p>

    <p>The DBC model in my opinion is much funner and inspires much more passion and hunger to learn then if a student were just sitting in a large lecture hall listening to a professor apathetically teach you a syllabus that he hasn’t changed majorly in years. I should say though that in my university experience there are some passionate lecturers who make honest attempts to try and make their student’s understand their material as well as possible. However the bell curve model of learning does work against them, and limit’s their options for different, novels ways to teach.
    </p>

    <h2>My feelings about entering this educational model </h2>

    <p> I feel cautiously optimistic. Excited. Slightly nervous. Inspired to work well and work hard. And driven to improve and iterate over my own learning processes. I want to surprise myself and tap into a new higher potential to learn and become the best apprentice I can be in the craft of coding. I feel like my class are on 100% the same page too. This again is refreshing coming from the “bell curve” institution of college. I am going to share with them, be a social learner and receive and give feedback kindly and passionately as the rising tide of learning in DBC lift’s all of our boats together.

    <h2> Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Computer Coding. The similarities in learning both crafts. </h2>

    <p>So I aim to eventually have a blog that covers just two broad topics: Brazilian Ji Jitsu and computer coding. These seemingly unrelated crafts actually have a surprising amount in common. In September of 2014, I took up both BJJ and computer coding at the same time. I was and still am a novice in both domaines. But as I learned both crafts I began to notice effective patterns for learning in both domains. Let me show you what I mean by first explaining how someone learns the martial art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

<p>
So in BJJ when you first start, before you can start to be creative with your movement and before you can start moving around from position to submission with ease, and escape tight spots while focusing on your next move you first need to get a grip with the basics. The basics are just the movements you will be repeating again and again and again as a beginner, and when you start you will not know these basic movements as muscle memory yet and therefore they will take up almost all of your conscious mental focus and energy to perform.
</p>

<p>
As a beginner in BJJ long before you start mastering the flow of moves leading to a complicated “gogoplata” submission, you will first need to master the scenario of trying to escape from being fully mounted. Or escaping from someone dominating you in side control. You find yourself in similar positions regularly as a beginner because those who are better then you will often put you into inferior positions, for you to try and struggle out of. The only effective, consistent and wise way to struggle out of these positions is by learning technique. Basic technique. This then provides you with enough of a platform to then get experience in other more dominant positions yourself. As you learn the basic escapes, you will then start finding yourself in positions for you to launch your own attacks. You might then start finding yourself in side control more and then asking yourself new questions like; how do I submit opponents from here, or how can I progress to a more dominant position?
</p>

<p>
As you progress in BJJ you learn the basics, then more advanced techniques, and then you find your own favorite area’s and develop and refine previous techniques while always trying to evolve your game. As a practitioner of BJJ you will also regularly be meeting with constant defeat. You will run into trouble through your errant processes, and you will be tapped out a lot by more advanced and experienced practitioners. You use failure as a learning tool to evolve your process. Then next time you roll, having iterated over your game, you are less likely to fail and more likely to succeed. Iterating over your game and using failure as a tool for development is a concept for learning that computer programer know well.
</p>

<p>
BJJ is like a filtering process for different kinds of egos too. The sport is not a sustainable one for those with a fixed mindset; a kind of person who’s pride get’s hurt once they are tapped which prevents them from going out as a beginner and getting tapped again. This unwillingness to expose their ignorance is a road block to learning and as a result those people with a  fixed mindset tend to get filtered out of BJJ and never make it past a few weeks in the sport.
</p>

<p>
Those with a growth mindset will thrive in the sport. As a beginner you will get tapped a lot, and I mean a lot. A person with a growth mindset uses failure as a tool for self improvement. A person with a growth mindset thinks to themselves when they are submitted “Oh damn I got caught there when I left my arm on that mat exposed; it’s okay though I’ll ask for advice from my rolling partner to improve and next time I’ll keep my elbows tucked to my body.” Hence my counter intuitive conclusion that it’s good for the mind to get submitted a lot in BJJ; it reminds you to nurture your growth mindset; it keep your ego humble, it makes you makes sure that you’re always willing to expose your ignorance and it makes you hungry to learn to get better! Failure can be harnessed as a learning tool.
</p>

<p>
Lastly in BJJ in order to learn a move you must watch in be performed, but more importantly you must physically try and perform it yourself a number of times to ingrain the movement into your muscle memory and to deeply understand it. It’s all well and good to watch 10 youtube videos on different submissions, but I quickly found that if you want a move in your arsenal, you must go out and drill it yourself.
</p>

<p>
Now let’s consider coding. In coding you will meet failure regularly especially as a beginner. You can choose to either embrace failure as a tool for learning and evolving you “coding game” or you use failure as an indicator that you are bad, you’ll always be bad, and you should be discouraged.
</p>

<p>
In coding you learn the basics (sublime, the command line, some languages etc.) before you move onto appreciating more refined aspects of the craft like engineering principals. You must learn the basics first though as a beginner, just like you must learn the basics in BJJ too.
</p>

<p>
In coding, you should always be hungry to learn and enjoy the learning process not the product. Don’t think I need to have a good program instead think I need to have a good process which will result in a good program. Similarly in BJJ you don’t think I need to submit the opponent, instead you think what string of moves and defenses can I employ in connected steps which as a result will lead me to victory.
</p>

<p>
In coding you learn through doing. (Learn coding the hard way) You can read and learn from books but to ingrain the actually code and understanding deeply into your brain, you need to actually engage experimentally with code, and embrace potential failure too and use it as a learning tool to evolve your game. Sounds a lot like learning BJJ through drilling moves!
</p>

<p>
In both domaines you learn through doing, you learn through having good mentors, you can have a strong skill set by being both a generalist and a specialist in certain areas, And very interestingly in both area’s of work if you are passionate about the learning process you will find yourself slipping into flow and the part of your brain responsible for being aware of time will stop working as well and hours will fly by while you are so deeply connected with your craft that you don’t even notice. This is a sacred place though where I want to exist in all of the time. It’s not easy to get their all of the time though, but at Dev Bootcamp they really want you and your class to be in this place all of the time! And right now, I feel like I am about to get into my computer coding vehicle for learning, and bomb down DBC’s autobahn for learning!
</p>

<p>
So in conclusion learning code is a lot like learning BJJ, and I will chronicle my rise from white belt in both domains to hopefully one day a black belt in both! However I predict that this will take a lot of years and hard work, but right now I am enjoying the process in both crafts every day! Let the rolling and coding continue!!
