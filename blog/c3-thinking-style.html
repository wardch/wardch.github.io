     <h1>My Thinking Style: Addressing the holes in my thinking game! </h1>
    <h2>I'm trying to strive to become more aware here of how I learn, and what my weaknesses are so that I can develop them into strengths! </h2>

    <h2> Results from the Gregorc test of thinking styles </h2>

    <p>
      A test was designed by Anthoney Gregorc to catagorize people into the various kinds of learners that they are. Different people have different ways of approaching problems, and ideal environments within which they learn. There are four catagories, within which people may fall. Typically people will have traits belonging to a number of different catagories. My results are below:
    </p>

    <p>
      #Insert table.

      Abstract random:  56
      Abstract sequential: 40
      Concrete random: 20
      Concrete sequential: 4
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm heavily pulled towards the Abstract Random (AR) and Abstract Sequential (AS) modes of learning, and pushed away from Concrete Random (CR) methods of learning, while strongly pushed away from Concrete Sequential (CS) methods of learning. I think this is a pretty accurate assessment of how I am at this point in time. I'm going to try and mull over AR learning now, and if that's a good portrait of how I learn because I got a near maximum score of 60 in that category.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract Random Learner. </h2>
    <p>
      Basically these kinds of learners like to work in groups, they try to be sensitive to the emotions of others and they like being in the company of others.

      They prefer to cooperate then to work solo on things. They are good listeners, and like to make those around them feel happy. The pick up on non verbal cues given off by people about how others might be feeling.

      We (AR learners) need frequent feedback. For me I think I value feedback very highly, I feel like I could always do with more! Am I where I need to be? Is my work at the right standard? Am I on the right track? This piece of information about feedback made me realize that I should make more of an effort to go to office hours and ask the tutors how am I progressing along, and could they offer any advice to point me in the right direction!


      <p>
      AR learners need an outlet for their creativity. This is also true about me, I like to talk to people about ideas that I am having. I like to write, to read, to create videos, and to chat to people and pursue interesting things outside of my comfort zone. I think once you are doing something you are passionate about, creativity soon follows, and it's a great feeling! I've always tried to cultivate this kind of  creative and fun energy. I realized that if I can strive to create a creative outlet within the work that I am doing, then my learning style will be harness and used to it's fullest! So get creative with how I learn and write code, was the main take away here!
      </p>

      <h2> AR learners don't like conflict: The Burrito story as a case in point! </h2>
      AR learners really don’t like conflict, which for me was extremely true! It brings to mind a pretty funny incident that happened to you in a burrito shop a few months ago, highlighting how you negative conflict rubs you the wrong way!
      About a month ago I was in a burrito place, where the woman behind the till had a reputation for her frosty service.Even before we walked in the door, the woman at the till had a thousand yard stare, and a face that looked a little disgruntled all of the time!

      <p>
        I asked her for a burrito, with salsa in in and she just kinda stared at me. And then I looked back at her and she went "WELL, are you a student or not! I'm not going to keep asking you questions!" and for the sake of an easier overall experience I bit my tongue and just replied politely that I was, then paid her then got a ticket.But I could sense that she wanted to vent more somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my friends and I were laughing, being goofy but not obnoxiously so, while waiting for the burrito and then in front of a pretty packed shop the frosty cashier said to me "That they were trying to help me out by making me a burrito and that I should act more respectfully towards them!" I thought this was a really passive-aggressive thing to say, and I felt like she was trying to publicly  embarrass or bully me in front of the shop and all of it's customers because she wanted to take me down a peg. I monitored how I was feeling and almost on reflex in front of a shop of people "I think you are really rude." My friends and I got our burrito and left and a few people who were students in the shop agreed that she was mean and rude most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this was a pretty ugly scenario, and for some reason I just couldn't stop thinking about it for the next few days. My friends told me that I was 100% justified to say what I did, but even still I thought even if I was right, there is still nothing admirable about someone how embarrasses someone else in public like I had done. AR thinkers do not like conflict, and I guess I agree with that. More precisely I don't like negative, unkind conflict. So the next day I was walking past the shop with a friend and I told him the back story and told him I'm going to try and see if I can apologize for what I did, and hear here out too. My friend told me, he doubts she'd even remember what happened!
      </p>
      <p>
        I went up to the til and said "Hey, listen I was in here a like a week ago, and I think we had a bit of a back and forth, and I think I may have called you rude in front of the shop but I didn't like the way I handeled that scenario so I'm sorry!" Then she replied that initially didn't remember the incident (my friend later joked with me about that later!) but then she said that sometimes she can get really stressed and tempermental and that she didn't mean it. We decided to let the past be water under the bridge and now me and the burrito lady always have pretty funny chats when ever I come into the store haha! So yeah, on the not liking conflict side of things, I definitely fit into that category!
    </p>



    <h2> Sources of Stress for an AR learner </h2>
    </p>I really don’t like to be alone for too long which I quite typical of an AR learner. I've noticed that if I spend like a full day without any human interaction I end up becoming a little bit kooky or off! </p>

    <p>
    I also do not like when people jump to negative conclusions. I always try and be positive, and  choose to find positivity in things. This may sound insentive but for my own personal outlook on life, I believe that I can choose to be happy if I want. If something isn't right or is stressing my out, I like to deal with it so that I am happy again! Negativity is something I always try and distance myself from, since negativity never leads to relaxed and healthy ways of learning or thinking. I also read in the book Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman that your working memory is affected by how stressed you are. AR thinkers and myself believe that: negative thinking => stress => worse working memory => worse learning.
    </p>

    <p>
    Timing is a sources of stress for people like me too. Finishing one thing before starting another can be difficult. I find working within deadlines can be very difficult, as I tend to over read and over-research before getting started. I'd rather delay putting out a minimal viable product (MVP), and instead try and put out an higher level of work closer to a dead line. This can lead to a huge build up of stress for me around deadlines, and so AR thinkers can suffer in this department. But the first step towards positive change is to be aware of your current state! <p>

    <p>
    Lastly AR learners need emotional support otherwise they will become stressed out and wont be working near their full potential. I can strongly identify with the desire for emotional support, and the need to surround yourself with positive, sensitive and funny people! In the last year I have really began to appreciate the importance of self-awareness and emotional intelligence as a master aptitude which helps every other aspect of your life. I've tried to cultivate emotional intelligence through meditation, yoga and through my experience last summer working with sensory deprivation tanks, in Boulder, Colorado.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeqmKwsvM58"> Sensory Deprivation Tanks Intro Video </a>

    <p>
    So yeah, being around people in an emotionally nourishing environment is how I like to learn.
    </p>

    <h2> Abstract Sequential Thinkers </h2>

    <p>
    These kinds of thinkers need proof to back up assertions. They look for data, they look for the opinions of experts in fields before they draw inferences. This is exactly how I think actually, before I form an opinion on something I like to look at the history of the topic, I ask what are expert's opinions, what does the data say, and does the data support what I happen to observe?
    </p>

    <p>
    AS thinkers like to create things which solves a need, or makes a system run more effectively or smoothly. This sounds a lot like an entrepreneur. Which was what I believe myself to be. Creating to solve a need, that’s when I’m myself! That's when I can slip into a state of flow!
    </p>

    <p>
    AS people would almost rather not do the work at all, then do it in a haphazardness manner. Again this is extremely true for me, and it's a weakness with how I approach work. I often try and over-read before tackling my work but I'm getting better at this. I realize that I should aim to be more comfortable with starting and finishing a project without knowing every single detail about how things work. I should try and become more comfortable  with iterating over previous attempts and then making them better. I want to try and break the habit of theory over practice, of reading over experimenting!
    </p>

    <p>
    Reading about how I like to create to solve a problem and about how I like to work with people and their emotions made me think maybe I should perhaps go into the field of social entrepreneurship.Combining emotional awareness as an abstract reasoner with the creative problem solving of abstract sequential thinkers.
    </p>

    <p>
    Again apparently these types of thinkers do not like to be rushed while working, they like to explore all of the facts before acting. This set off a mini-alarm in my head. In both of my learning styles, the issue of time management was brought up. I am now even more aware of how I am going to manage my time and approach my work then ever.

    Sometimes I will get so absorbed into the task at hand that I don’t hand in work until right before the deadline because I think it could be of a higher standard. This can cause me to be stressed out though, and if I leave too much work to do in too short an amount of time before a deadline arrives, it can cause me to miss deadlines sometimes, which doesn't feel great. However I strongly believe that being aware of something, is the first step you need to wards changing it. And I am going to resolve to be better at managing my time next week.




  <h2>What has been the biggest struggle for you so far? </h2>

  <p>
    The biggest struggle for me thus far has been, getting work done quickly. I seem to allow the work to expand to fill the time I have.  I find that I’ll go on tangents or down rabbit holes with my work and suddenly I’ll get less done then I had hoped! If I could nail down the issue of getting work done, within deadlines that I set myself maybe I’d feel a lot better and get the same amount of work produced in a shorter amount of time. Apparently my learning style doesn’t like to be rushed or working within time limits, however a person with a growth mindset believes that with the right amount of effort, I can change my habits and the way I approach work. I strongly agree with this growth mindset theory. I need to adapt my approach to suit my learning style, and for week 4 at DBC I've tailored a schedule for myself to try and develop my deadline/timing weaknesses as an AR and AS thinker!
    </p>

    <h2>What Can I Do to Strengthen my Thinking and Learning weaknesses and play to my strengths</h2>
    <h3>Early Rise!</h3>
     I listened to a pod-cast and a news article this week about the merits of getting up early! A common denominator for a lot of successful people is that they tend to rise early! I can see my weekly routine this coming week being, every night make a to-do list the night before, and then get working on it the following morning. This means I can start working on things directly after breakfast and immediately fall into the habit of taking the shortest route possible for each challenge and produce and MVP as quickly as possible and in the process trying to tackle my weakness of over-researching/over-reading too much!
     </p>

     <p>
     So learners like me need emotional support and nourishment to thrive, they like to feel positive and happy. I should perhaps to do something I like in the morning before I start my days work. I’d like to meditate, do yoga or exercise. This will allow me to go into my learning enviorment with a happy mindset, this frame of mind is important for an AR learner, thus playing to my strengths.
     </p>

     <p>
    Waking up early at like 6/6:30am also means that you will have the morning to yourself. Other people's priorities will not interfer with yourself until you've been up for at least 5 hours! That's a lot of alone time to get work done! Being up in the morning also feels great too, there's a kind of peaceful electricity in the air! David Henry Theroux once said about being up early in the morning:

    <q>Let me have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will not drink of this at the fountainhead of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some and sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket to morning time in this world.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
    When I wake up in the morning, drink a glass of water, exercise or meditate, eat breakfast and then begin my days work. I will try and "eat my frogs first", which means doing the harder things before the easier things. However studies have shown that you should try and begin your day doing any writing that you will have to do at some point during the day. The task of writting apperently focuses the mind and primes it for work later on in the day. So I will begin the day by doing any writing that needs to be done, and then code for the remainder of the day and take notes, trying to get through each challenge as swiftly as possible to again deal with my
    </p>


    <h3>Try and make your work as appealing as possible, use rewards and make it fun!</h3>
    <p>
    Learning preferences: I like to be pulled towards my work, it's when I produce at my highest standard! I have an aural and visual learning preference and I also like to ask questions. This week I will try and play to my strengths. I will try and go to office hours at least twice, to ask questions. I will try and watch videos on material to help me absorb it and play to my strengths. I'll rewards myself for good work produced. I want to be pulled towards your work every day, in a way where my inner voices says “I can’t believe this is even work, this is so much fun!”.
    </p>

    <h3> Be aware of when you are entering a rabbit hole </h3>
    This coming week I will try and be much more direct with my work. I will try and see if I can get a project in, without over reading on it too much. Just get the MVP in. This concept is something I need to embrace and be more comfortable with. Once I have a minimum viable product, then I can go back to it and build it up even more with my reading. To be specific, when I was learning CSS and HTML I poured over books and articles instead of coding more experimentally. I wrote notes and flash cards, but I could have spent that time creating an MVP. So when I am creating an MVP I won't time box myself as strictly, but I will take breaks. When I am reading up on notes and run the risk of over-reading and not getting started, I will time box myself and not go over that amount of time. This will force me to begin breaking the habit of not getting started until I feel fully prepared! Because we are always outside of our comfort zones, getting started without all of the information is just something I am going to have to embrace!
    </p>

    <h3> Imagining how I'll feel! </h3>

    <p>
     I already feel better about tackling the workload for next week, now that I've become more aware of how I am failing and how I can succeed! I've resolved to myself to get up early this week. I've resolved to be happy before I settle down to work. And I've resolved to spend less time in theory and side learning, and more time being direct with getting challenges done. Time to put my new work approach in action for this week!
