Hi I'm Charlie, I'm 23 years old and I'm from Dublin Ireland.

I love to learn how to code, and this website is a place where I document my previous thoughts on different topics or ideas relating to computer code.

For the next 9 weeks (April 6th - June 12th) I will begin my time at Dev BootCamp San Francisco. I'm going to use this blog as a took for documenting what I learned to help organize my and make my thoughts more concrete as I bomb down the DBC autobahn of learning! Stay tuned as I try and discover how to create beautiful and meaningful things!
