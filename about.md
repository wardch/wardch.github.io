<p></p>
I'm a junior software developer who has a background in mathematical economics and political science. For the last 6 months or so I have been attending Dev Bootcamp, an intense 19+ week education program, so that I could learn how to code, but perhaps more importantly "learn how to learn". At DBC self-guided learning is encouraged, and you are strongly encouraged to use techniques of learning which have been empirically tested and proven to be effective.

I'm also a dual citizen meaning that although I grew up in Dublin, I am free to work in the US or EU without restriction.

I believe it's important to be happy and self-fulfilled through identifying your passions and then pursing them vigorously.

Please don't hesitate to connect with my on LinkedIn/Twitter or drop me an email at charlieward18@gmail.com!
