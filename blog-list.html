        <h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
        <p>I'll try and break down the topics of Arrays and Hashes, their similarities and differences, for an audience with little prior background knowledge of these concepts.So let's start with an array. You can think of an array, as a kind of filing cabinet for things! Let's imgaine we have a filing cabinet that we use to "store" the names of different reptiles. We can choose how many reptiles names we would like to store in the cabinet. When we open the cabinet up, there are an infinite amount of "slots" (or indexes) for us to store our reptile names. So we want to make our first entry into the cabinet with the word "turtle".

        <h1>My Thinking Styles</h1>
        <p> I'm trying to strive to become more aware here of how I learn, and what my weaknesses are so that I can develop them into strengths!  A test was designed by Anthoney Gregorc to catagorize people into the various kinds of learners that they are. Different people have different ways of approaching problems, and ideal environments within which they learn. There are four catagories, within which people may fall. Typically people will have traits belonging to a number of different catagories. My results are below:

        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>I'll try offer some insight into the difference between CSS positioning types, namely relative, fixed and absolute.
          <p>Relative positioning is relatively easy to understand! If you type in a css file:

            h1 {
            position:relative;
            left: 50px;
          }

          It means that the elements between all of the h1 tags in your HTML file, will appear 50px to the left of where they would have appeared otherwise!

        <h1>Cooking in the DBC kitchen! </h1>
        <p> In this blog post I’d like to try and compare the DBC model of education to the more traditional models of education which I have been involved in for the last 4 years of my life, namely the university. I want to compare DBC with other institutions of education such as the university to highlight the differences in effective teaching methods that are applied in DBC but not the university, and as a result DBC offer’s a steeper learning curve to it’s students then a typical university.</p>

        <h1>Version Control</h1>
        <p> Version Control is a tool that developers use to help them take a file, and build it up incrementally. Simply put, "version control" really just means having multiple versions of your file saved, in a chronological order. To explain version control better, I think it's helpful to take the analogy of a character progressing through a level on a game.
