        <div class="overflow">
        <p> It is useful to think of classes as factories for producing objects. You can choose what feature you would like each object manufactured from your class to have. You can bestow innate methods to each object created from a class, by defining methods within the class first. Let's run through a real world scenario for clarity! Imagine you owned a Pet store and you needed a way to keep track of all of your pets in your store which may have a lot of different values for their attribute such as weight, price, color etc. Then the creation of a class called Pet would help your endeavor tremendously.

        <p> As technology advances jobs sectors are going to be destroyed at a rate so quick that it has no historical precedent. History has shown us though that when unemployment rates become too high the social and political consequences are real: ranging from protests to riots, and even full blown revolutions. In this post I will discuss advancements in the tech industry and the tsunami of unemployment coming in the direction of industrial societies

        <div class="overflow">
        <p> The method group_by in Ruby is a pretty aptly named method. You'd use this method when there are a bunch of objects which you would like to organize into groups. For example let's say you have a list of 6 words and you'd like to organize those words into groups, based on the length of each word. You use the method "group_by" to form a hash, where each "group" contains words, and each group is unique, containing only words of a certain length! And that's group_by briefly explained, but my "words:example" ratio is getting alarmingly high, so I'll demonstrate how nice an enumerable method group by really is:

        <p> I'm trying to become more self-aware about how I learn, because the first step to positive change I believe is self-awareness. I started my self-examination with a test that was designed by Anthoney Gregorc to categorize people into the various kinds of learners that they are. Different people have different ways of approaching problems, and ideal environments within which they learn. There are four categories, within which people may fall. Typically people will have traits belonging to a number of different categories. My results are below:

        <h1>What is Pair Programming?</h1>
        <div class="overflow">
        <p>Pair programming is a technique used by developers to collaborate with each other on their code.
        Usually, pairs of programmers will assume the roles of "driver" and "navigator".
        With pair programming, developers can work together to establish a strategic direction for
        their projects and review each others' code.

        <p>I'll try and break down the topics of Arrays and Hashes, their similarities and differences, for an audience with little prior background knowledge of these concepts.So let's start with an array. You can think of an array, as a kind of filing cabinet for things! Let's imgaine we have a filing cabinet that we use to "store" the names of different reptiles. We can choose how many reptiles names we would like to store in the cabinet. When we open the cabinet up, there are an infinite amount of "slots" (or indexes) for us to store our reptile names. So we want to make our first entry into the cabinet with the word "turtle".

        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <div class="overflow">
        <p>I'll try offer some insight into the difference between CSS positioning types, namely relative, fixed and absolute.
        </p>

        <p>Relative positioning is relatively easy to understand! If you type in a css file: <br>

            h1 {
            position:relative;
            left: 50px;
          }

          It means that the elements between all of the h1 tags in your HTML file, will appear 50px to the left of where they would have appeared otherwise!

          <p> In this blog post I’d like to try and compare the DBC model of education to the more traditional models of education which I have been involved in for the last 4 years of my life, namely the university. I want to compare DBC with other institutions of education such as the university to highlight the differences in effective teaching methods that are applied in DBC but not the university, and as a result DBC offer’s a steeper learning curve to it’s students then a typical university.</p>

        <h1>Version Control</h1>
        <div class="overflow">
          <p> Version Control is a tool that developers use to help them take a file, and build it up incrementally. Simply put, "version control" really just means having multiple versions of your file saved, in a chronological order. To explain version control better, I think it's helpful to take the analogy of a character progressing through a level on a game.
